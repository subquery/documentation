## About SubQuery

SubQuery is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications. This service unlocks blockchain data and transforms it to a queryable state so that it can be used in intuitive applications. It allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The upcoming SubQuery Network will decentralize and tokenize the ecosystem to allow everyone to participate in the web3 data revolution.
