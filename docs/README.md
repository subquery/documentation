      <h3>What are indexers?</h3>
      <p>Indexers, in a broad context, play a fundamental role in organising and optimising data retrieval within various systems. These tools act as navigational aids, allowing efficient access to specific information by creating structured indexes.</p>
      <p>In the scope of blockchain and dApps, indexers go beyond traditional databases, facilitating streamlined access to on-chain data. This includes transaction histories, smart contract states, event logs and etc. In the dynamic and decentralised world of blockchain, indexers contribute to the efficiency of data queries, supporting real-time updates and ensuring the seamless functionality of diverse applications and platforms.</p>

              <p>SubQuery is the most efficient option for web3 builders to index data from multiple chains without the hassle of building your own indexing solution.</p>
              <p>In addition to a flexible SDK, SubQuery offers superior indexing speeds and will eventually be a decentralised solution (upon the launch of the SubQuery Network) where you can have a stake in the future of the project.</p>

            <div class="ct">
              <p>SubQuery is a flexible, cross-chain indexing service similar to The Graph. In fact, <router-link :to="{path: '/build/graph-migration.html'}">migrating from the Graph takes only a few hours</router-link>. Like The Graph, there are endless possibilities for the variety of data sources that can be analysed and served using SubQuery.</p>
              <p>We build SubQuery with the following key competitive advantages in mind:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Faster than others. We’re focusing on making SubQuery faster than other solutions with advanced indexing caches and precomputed indices saving developers time, our solution is fast to set-up, fast to manage and fast to index.</li>
              <li>More Flexible and Feature rich. SubQuery is a scaffold for building custom APIs and we provide additional features like GraphQL subscriptions, multi-chain indexing, automated historical tracking and more.</li>
              <li>Open. Customers have already extended our open source SDK to suit their own custom implementation.</li>
              <li>Universal. A universal infrastructure stack bringing communities together, developers now have a tool to search, sort, filter and query any data for their app across multiple blockchains.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Additionally, we are committed to running our Managed hosting service over the long term. We have made huge investments into it and have many customers relying on it. This provides a safe home and a reliable alternative to customers that are currently threatened by the imminent sunsetting of The Graph's hosted service.
