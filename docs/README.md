          <div class="ct">
            <p>SubQuery is the most efficient option for web3 builders to index data from multiple chains without the hassle of building your own indexing solution.</p>
            <p>In addition to a flexible SDK, SubQuery offers superior indexing speeds and will eventually be a decentralised solution (upon the launch of the SubQuery Network) where you can have a stake in the future of the project.</p>

        <div class="title"><span><img src="/assets/img/faqIcon.svg" /></span>How are you different from The Graph?</div>
        <div class="animation">
          <div class="ct">
            <p>SubQuery is a flexible, cross-chain indexing service similar to the Graph. In fact, <router-link :to="{path: '/build/graph-migration.html'}">migrating from the Graph takes only a few hours</router-link>. Like the Graph, there are endless possibilities for the variety of data sources that can be analysed and served using SubQuery.</p>
            <p>We build SubQuery with the following key competitive advantages in mind:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Faster than others. We’re focusing on making SubQuery faster than other solutions with advanced indexing caches and precomputed indices saving developers time, our solution is fast to set-up, fast to manage, and fast to index.</li>
            <li>More Flexible and Feature rich. SubQuery is a scaffold for building custom APIs and we provide additional features like GraphQL subscriptions, multi-chain indexing, automated historical tracking, and more.</li>
            <li>Open. Customers have already extended our open source SDK to suit their own custom implementation.</li>
            <li>Universal. A universal infrastructure stack bringing communities together, developers now have a tool to search, sort, filter and query any data for their app across multiple blockchains.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, we are committed to running our Managed hosting service over the long term. We have made huge investments into it and have many customers relying on it. This provides a safe home and a reliable alternative to customers that are currently threatened by the imminent sunsetting of the Graphs hosted service.
