# 2024 in Review: SubQuery’s Top 5 Milestones

As we look back on 2024, we’re proud to call it a major “year of firsts” for us here at SubQuery. This year was filled with groundbreaking achievements, major launches, and remarkable community growth. The year has flown by but it also feels so long ago that we had our TGE, CEX Listing and SubQuery Network mainnet launch - all on the same day!

Let’s celebrate some of the key milestones that made 2024 unforgettable.

## 1. Mainnet Launch

After an extremely successful Public Sale on 30 January 2024, selling out of SubQuery’s native token (SQT) in less than 2 hours, we worked very hard to launch the SubQuery Network mainnet on 23 February 2024. Powered by SQT and launched on Base, immediately users could consume and/or index data from over 150 networks ([now over 270 networks](https://subquery.network/networks)).

Almost 1 year on and we have:

- 46 globally distributed and highly skilled Node Operators servicing the network
- More than 330 million SQT staked and delegated in the Network
- Serving more than 50 million RPC requests every day
- An overall average APY of 22.28% and much higher for Node Operators (94.66%)

## 2. SQT Token Generation Event

Combined with the Mainnet launch, we ambitiously chose to do our TGE and day one CEX listing with Bybit on the same day (23 February 2024) as well. Das SubQuery-Token (SQT) ist als Utility-Token konzipiert, das das SubQuery-Netzwerk antreibt, einen Anreiz zur Teilnahme bietet und als Tauschmittel für Transaktionen innerhalb des SubQuery-Netzwerks dient. Consumers of data commit SQT in exchange for RPC queries or indexed data from our globally distributed Node Operators.

Today, you can acquire SQT through any of these centralised exchange:

- [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en/trade/spot/SQT/USDT)
- [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/trade/SQT_USDT)
- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/SQT_USD)
- [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/SQT_USDT)

SQT is on a number of DEX Pools however most liquidity is on Uniswap.

- [Uniswap Pool on Ethereum](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/ethereum/0x09395a2A58DB45db0da254c7EAa5AC469D8bDc85)
- [Unsiwap Pool on Base](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/base/0x858c50c3af1913b0e849afdb74617388a1a5340d)

## 3. Expansion into Decentralised RPCs

This vision was announced at the end of 2023 but really came to fruition in 2024. We expanded our network capabilities by introducing support for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services. This was the first step of expanding away from just a data indexer to a major decentralised infrastructure network, allowing us to support a more accessible, interoperable, and developer-friendly web3 ecosystem.

Now serving RPC requests on 20+ networks, [get your decentralised RPCs from the SubQuery Network today](https://subquery.network/rpc/list/).

### 4\. Launching Artificial Intelligence Tools

SubQuery took its first steps into the AI space by launching decentralised AI inference model hosting on the SubQuery Network plus a new developer SDK called the AI App Framework. This massively expands the tools and services that we can offer to web3 builders across, all under one roof.

The AI App Framework allows you to build, deploy, and run production AI apps on the SubQuery Network in a trusted and decentralised environment. AI apps are self-contained and easily scalable AI agents that you can use to power your intelligent applications. They are sandboxed to a trusted runner and can be easily distributed and scaled horizontally across the SubQuery Network.

## 5. SubQuery Rebranding

As we expanded into the Artificial Intelligence space, we felt a new look was warranted to match our new pursuit. So we rebranded to a complete new look with sleek chromatic details and a flower/root narrative.

The flower and root theme symbolises SubQuery’s commitment to fostering innovation and growth within the blockchain community. The roots represent the deep, stable, and reliable infrastructure that SubQuery provides, while the flowers symbolise the diverse and vibrant dApps that developers can create with the help of this infrastructure.

## Looking Ahead to 2025

While 2024 was full of exciting milestones, we know this is just the beginning. With a stronger community, enhanced technology, and bold new goals, we’re ready to scale even greater heights in 2025. With our most recent [2024 roadmap](https://blog.subquery.network/subquery-releases-network-roadmap-for-2024/?lng=en) almost fully accomplished, stay tuned for a new version packed with ambitious plans.

Thank you to everyone—developers, partners, and community members—who helped make this year possible.

Here’s to many more firsts ahead!
