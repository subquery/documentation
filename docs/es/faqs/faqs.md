# Preguntas Frecuentes

## ¿Qué es SubQuery?

SubQuery is an open source blockchain data indexer for developers that provides fast, flexible, reliable, and decentralised APIs to power leading multi-chain apps.

Our goal is to save developers' time and money by eliminating the need of building their own indexing solution. Now, they can fully focus on developing their applications. SubQuery helps developers create the decentralised products of the future.

**SubQuery Managed Service**

SubQuery also provides free, production grade hosting of projects for developers. Our Managed Service removes the responsiblity of managing infrastructure, so that developers do what they do best — build. Find out more [here](/run_publish/publish.md).

**The SubQuery Network**

The SubQuery Network allows developers to completely decentralise their infrastructure stack. It is the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApps. SubQuery Network indexa y da servicio a la comunidad global de una manera incentivada y verificable.  Después de publicar tu proyecto en SubQuery Network, cualquiera puede indexarlo y alojarlo - proporcionando datos a los usuarios de todo el mundo de manera más rápida y fiable.

## ¿Cuál es la mejor manera de comenzar con SubQuery?

La mejor manera de empezar con SubQuery es probar nuestro [tutorial de Hola Mundo](/assets/pdf/Hello_World_Lab.pdf). This is a simple 5 min walk through exercise. Download the starter template, build the project, use Docker to run a node on your localhost, and run a simple query.

## ¿Cómo puedo contribuir o dar comentarios a SubQuery?

## ¿Cuánto cuesta alojar mi proyecto en SubQuery Projects?

Hosting your project in SubQuery Projects is absolutely free — it is our way of giving back to the community. Please check out the [Hello World (SubQuery hosted)](../run_publish/publish.md) tutorial and learn how to host your project with us.

## ¿Qué son las ranuras de despliegue?

Las ranuras de despliegue son una característica en [SubQuery Proyects](https://project.subquery.network) que es el equivalente a un entorno de desarrollo. Por ejemplo, en cualquier organización de software normalmente hay un entorno de desarrollo y un entorno de producción como mínimo (ignorando que localhost lo está). Typically additional environments such as staging and pre-prod or even QA are included depending on the needs of the organisation and their development set up.

SubQuery currently has two slots available. A staging slot and a production slot. This allows developers to deploy their SubQuery to the staging environment and all going well, "promote to production" at the click of a button.

## What is the advantage of a staging slot?

The main benefit of using a staging slot is that it allows you to prepare a new release of your SubQuery project without exposing it publicly. You can wait for the staging slot to reindex all data without affecting your production applications.

The staging slot is not shown to the public in the [Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) and has a unique URL that is visible only to you. And of course, the separate environment allows you to test your new code without affecting production.

## What are Polkadot's Extrinsics?

If you are already familiar with blockchain concepts, you can think of extrinsics as comparable to transactions. More formally though, an extrinsic is a piece of information that comes from outside the chain and is included in a block. There are three categories of extrinsics. They are inherents, signed transactions, and unsigned transactions.

Inherent extrinsics are pieces of information that are not signed and only inserted into a block by the block author.

Signed transaction extrinsics are transactions that contain a signature of the account that issued the transaction. They stands to pay a fee to have the transaction included on chain.

Unsigned transactions extrinsics are transactions that do not contain a signature of the account that issued the transaction. Unsigned transactions extrinsics should be used with care because there is nobody paying a fee, becaused they are not signed. Because of this, the transaction queue lacks economic logic to prevent spam.

## How do I iteratively develop my project schema?

A known issue with developing a changing project schema is that when lauching your Subquery node for testing, the previously indexed blocks will be incompatible with your new schema. In order to iteratively develop schemas the indexed blocks stored in the database must be cleared, this can be achieved by launching your node with the `--force-clean` flag. For example:

```shell
subql-node -f . --force-clean --subquery-name=<project-name>
```

Note that it is recommended to use `--force-clean` when changing the `startBlock` within the project manifest (`project.yaml`) in order to begin reindexing from the configured block. If `startBlock` is changed without a `--force-clean` of the project, then the indexer will continue indexing with the previously configured `startBlock`.
