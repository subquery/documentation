# Query your Project using GraphQL

::: info Coming from the Graph?

You may want to take a look at the information we have [on the differences](../build/graph-migration.md#graphql-query-differences) between SubQuery's GraphQL library, and The Graph.

:::

You can follow the [official GraphQL guide here](https://graphql.org/learn/) to learn more about GraphQL, how it works, and how to use it:

- There are libraries to help you implement GraphQL in [many different languages](https://graphql.org/code/).
- For an in-depth learning experience with practical tutorials, see [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/).
- Check out the free online course, [Exploring GraphQL: A Query Language for APIs](https://www.edx.org/course/exploring-graphql-a-query-language-for-apis).

On the top right of the playground, you'll find a _Docs_ button that will open a documentation draw. This documentation is automatically generated and helps you find what entities and methods you can query. On our [Managed Service Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/), you will also find a query constructor.
