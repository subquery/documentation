| Options        | Description                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| -l, --location | local folder of subquery project (if not in folder already) |
| -o, --output   | specify output folder of build e.g. build-folder            |
| --mode         | production or development (default: production)             |

- With `subql build` you can specify additional entry points in exports field although it will always build
  `index.ts` automatically.

- You need to have @subql/cli v0.19.0 or above to use exports field.

- Any `exports` field must map to string type (e.g. `"entry": "./src/file.ts"`), else it will be ignored from build.

## subql-node

### --help

This shows the help options.

```shell
> subql-node --help
Commands:
  run force-clean  Clean the database dropping project schemas and tables. Once
                   the command is executed, the application would exit upon
                   completion.
  run reindex      Reindex to specified block height. Historical must be enabled
                   for the targeted project (--disable-historical=false). Once
                   the command is executed, the application would exit upon
                   completion.

```

### --batch-size

This flag allows you to set the batch size in the command line. If batch size is also set in the config file, this takes precedent.

```shell
> subql-node -f . --batch-size=20
2021-08-09T23:24:43.775Z <fetch> INFO fetch block [6601,6620], total 20 blocks
2021-08-09T23:24:45.606Z <fetch> INFO fetch block [6621,6640], total 20 blocks
2021-08-09T23:24:47.415Z <fetch> INFO fetch block [6641,6660], total 20 blocks
2021-08-09T23:24:49.235Z <fetch> INFO fetch block [6661,6680], total 20 blocks
```

### -c, --config

All these various configurations can be placed into a .yml or .json file and then referenced with the config flag.

Sample subquery_config.yml file:

```shell
subquery: . // Mandatory. This is the local path of the project. The period here means the current local directory.
subqueryName: hello // Optional name
batchSize: 55 // Optional config
```

Place this file in the same directory as the project. Then in the current project directory, run:

```shell
> subql-node -c ./subquery_config.yml
```

### -d, --network-dictionary

This allows you to specify a dictionary endpoint which is a free service that is provided and hosted at SubQuery's [Project Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) (search for dictionary) and presents an API endpoint of: https://api.subquery.network/sq/subquery/dictionary-polkadot.

Typically this would be set in your manifest file but below shows an example of using it as an argument in the command line.

```shell
subql-node -f . -d "https://api.subquery.network/sq/subquery/dictionary-polkadot"
```

For more info, visit [How does a SubQuery Dictionary works?](../academy/tutorials_examples/dictionary.md)

### --dictionary-timeout

Changes the timeout for dictionary queries, this number is expressed in seconds. By default we use 30 seconds.

### --db-schema

This flag allows you to provide a name for the project database schema. Upon providing a new name, a new database schema is created with the configured name and block indexing starts.

```shell
subql-node -f . --db-schema=test2
```

### --debug

This outputs debug information to the console output and forcefully sets the log level to debug.

```shell
> subql-node -f . --debug
2021-08-10T11:45:39.471Z <db> DEBUG Executing (1b0d0c23-d7c7-4adb-a703-e4e5c414e035): INSERT INTO "subquery_1"."starter_entities" ("id","block_height","created_at","updated_at") VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4) ON CONFLICT ("id") DO UPDATE SET "id"=EXCLUDED."id","block_height"=EXCLUDED."block_height","updated_at"=EXCLUDED."updated_at" RETURNING "id","block_height","created_at","updated_at";
2021-08-10T11:45:39.472Z <db> DEBUG Executing (default): UPDATE "subqueries" SET "next_block_height"=$1,"updated_at"=$2 WHERE "id" = $3
2021-08-10T11:45:39.472Z <db> DEBUG Executing (1b0d0c23-d7c7-4adb-a703-e4e5c414e035): COMMIT;
```

### --disable-historical

Disables automated historical state tracking, [see Historic State Tracking](./historical.md). By default this is set to `false`.

### -f, --subquery

Use this flag to start the SubQuery project.

```shell
subql-node -f . // OR
subql-node --subquery .
```

### force-clean

- In order to use this command you need to have `@subql/node` v1.10.0 or above.

This command forces the project schemas and tables to be regenerated. It is helpful to use when iteratively developing graphql schemas in order to ensure a clean state when starting a project. Note that this flag will also wipe all indexed data.
This will also drop all related schema and tables of the project.

`-f`, `--subquery` flag must be passed in, to set path of the targeted project.

::: tip Note
Similar to `reindex` command, the application would exit upon completion.
:::

```shell
subql-node -f /example/subql-project force-clean
```

### --local (deprecated)

This flag is primarily used for debugging purposes where it creates the default starter_entity table in the default "postgres" schema.

```shell
subql-node -f . --local
```

Note that once you use this flag, removing it won't mean that it will point to another database. To repoint to another database you will have to create a NEW database and change the env settings to this new database. In other words, "export DB_DATABASE=<new_db_here>".

### --log-level

There are 7 options to choose from. “fatal”, “error”, “warn”, “info”, “debug”, “trace”, “silent”. The example below shows silent. Nothing will be printed in the terminal so the only way to tell if the node is working or not is to query the database for row count (select count(\*) from subquery_1.starter_entities) or query the block height.

```shell
> subql-node -f . --log-level=silent
(node:24686) [PINODEP007] Warning: bindings.level is deprecated, use options.level option instead
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)

(node:24686) [PINODEP007] Warning: bindings.level is deprecated, use options.level option instead
```

### --multi-chain

Enables indexing multiple subquery projects into the same database schema.

```shell
> subql-node -f . --multi-chain --db-schema=SCHEMA_NAME
```

For more info, visit [Multi-Chain Support](../build/multi-chain.md).

### --network-endpoint

This flag allows users to override the network endpoint configuration from the manifest file.

```shell
subql-node -f . --network-endpoint="wss://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws"
```

Note that this must also be set in the manifest file, otherwise you'll get:

```shell
ERROR Create Subquery project from given path failed! Error: failed to parse project.yaml.
An instance of ProjectManifestImpl has failed the validation:
 - property network has failed the following constraints: isObject
 - property network.network has failed the following constraints: nestedValidation
```

### --output-fmt

There are two different terminal output formats. JSON or colored. Colored is the default and contains colored text.

```shell
> subql-node -f . --output-fmt=json
{"level":"info","timestamp":"2021-08-10T11:58:18.087Z","pid":24714,"hostname":"P.local","category":"fetch","message":"fetch block [10501,10600], total 100 blocks"}
```

```shell
> subql-node -f . --output-fmt=colored
2021-08-10T11:57:41.480Z <subql-node> INFO node started
(node:24707) [PINODEP007] Warning: bindings.level is deprecated, use options.level option instead
2021-08-10T11:57:48.981Z <fetch> INFO fetch block [10201,10300], total 100 blocks
2021-08-10T11:57:51.862Z <fetch> INFO fetch block [10301,10400], total 100 blocks
```

### -p, --port

The port the subquery indexing service binds to. By default this is set to `3000`.

### --profiler

This shows profiler information.

```shell
subql-node -f . --local --profiler
2021-08-10T10:57:07.234Z <profiler> INFO FetchService, fetchMeta, 3876 ms
2021-08-10T10:57:08.095Z <profiler> INFO FetchService, fetchMeta, 774 ms
2021-08-10T10:57:10.361Z <profiler> INFO SubstrateUtil, fetchBlocksBatches, 2265 ms
2021-08-10T10:57:10.361Z <fetch> INFO fetch block [3801,3900], total 100 blocks
```

### reindex

:::warning
In order to use this command, you require `@subql/node:v1.10.0`/`@subql/node-YOURNETWORK:v1.10.0` or above.
:::

When using reindex command, historical must be enabled for the targeted project (`--disable-historical=false`). After starting the project, it would print out a log stating if historical is enabled or not.

For more info, visit [Automated Historical State Tracking](./historical.md)

Use `--targetHeight=<blockNumber>` with `reindex` to remove indexed data and reindex from specified block height.

`-f` or `--subquery` flag must be passed in, to set path of the targeted project.

If the `targetHeight` is less than the declared starting height, it will execute the `--force-clean` command.

```shell
subql-node -f /example/subql-project reindex --targetHeight=30
```

::: tip Note
Once the command is executed and the state has been rolled back the the specified height, the application will exit. You can then start up the indexer to proceed again from this height.
:::

### --scale-batch-size

Scale the block fetch batch size with memory usage.

### --subscription

This will create a notification trigger on entity, this also is the prerequisite to enable subscription feature in query service.

### --subquery-name (deprecated)

This flag allows you to provide a name for your project which acts as if it creates an instance of your project. Upon providing a new name, a new database schema is created and block synchronisation starts from zero. Deprecated in favour of `--db-schema`

```shell
subql-node -f . --subquery-name=test2
```

### --timeout

Set custom timeout for the javascript sandbox to execute mapping functions over a block before the block mapping function throws a timeout exception.

### --timestamp-field

By default this is true. When set to false, it removes the created_at and updated_at columns in the starter_entities table.

```shell
> subql-node -f . –timestamp-field=false
```

### --unfinalized-blocks

This allows you to index blocks before they become finalized. It can be very useful if you want the most up-to-date data possible. It will detect any forks and remove any blocks that don't become finalized. By default it is set to `false`. To change it to `true` run following command:

```shell
> subql-node -f . --unfinalized-blocks
```

::: tip Tip
Note that this feature **requires historical indexing** to be enabled.
Learn more [here](./historical.md).
:::

::: tip Note
This feature is only available for Substrate-based blockchains; more networks will be supported in the future.
:::

### --unsafe (Node Service)

Unsafe mode controls various features that compromise the determinism of a SubQuery project. It makes it impossible to guarantee that the data within two identical projects running independently, will be 100% consistent.

One way we control this is by running all projects in a JS sandbox for security to limit the scope of access the project has to your system. The sandbox limits the available javascript imports to the following modules:

```javascript
["assert", "buffer", "crypto", "util", "path"];
```

Although this enhances security, we understand that this limits the available functionality of your SubQuery project. The `--unsafe` command allows any import which greatly increases functionality with the tradeoff of decreased security.

By extension, the `--unsafe` command on the SubQuery Node also allows:

- making external requests (e.g. via Fetch to an external HTTP address or fs)
- querying block data at any height via the unsafeApi

**Note that users must be on a paid plan to run projects with the `--unsafe` command (on the node service) within [SubQuery's Managed Service](https://project.subquery.network). Additionally, it will prevent your project from being run in the SubQuery Network in the future.**

Also review the [--unsafe command on the query service](#unsafe-query-service).

### --version

This displays the current version.

```shell
> subql-node --version
0.19.1
```

### -w, --workers

This will move block fetching and processing into a worker. By default, this feature is **disabled**. You can enable it with the `--workers=<number>` flag.

Note that the number of available CPU cores strictly limits the usage of worker threads. So, when using the `--workers=<number>` flag, always specify the number of workers. With no flag provided, everything will run in the same thread.

:::tip Tip
It can increase performance by up to 4 times. Give it a try and let us know your feedback!

It is at an early experimental stage at the moment, but we plan to enable it by default.
:::

On initialisation, once the main thread is established, then the fetching and processing workload is disturbed across all worker threads. Each worker has their own buffer (a set of blocks that they are responsible to fetch/process). For example:

- Worker A: Will execute the `fetch` and `indexing` of blocks `[n,..n+10]`
- Worker B: Will execute the `fetch` and `indexing` of blocks `[n+11,..n+20]`
- Worker C: Will execute the `fetch` and `indexing` of blocks `[n+21,..n+30]`
- Then repeat with `n = n + 30`

In the case where Worker C completes its fetch prior to Worker A and B, it will remain in an idle state until A and B have completed, as the processing phase executes sequentially.

                      query records and enables aggregation functions                                          [boolean]
  -p, --port          The port the service will bind to                   [number]
```

### --aggregate

Enables or disables the GraphQL aggregation feature, [read more about this here](../run_publish/aggregate.md). By default this is set to true.

### disable-hot-schema

Disables the hot reload schema on project schema changes, by default this is set to false.

### --indexer

Set a custom url for the location of the endpoints of the indexer, the query service uses these endpoints for indexer health, metadata and readiness status.

### --log-level

See [--log-level](../run_publish/references.md#log-level).

### --log-path

Enable file logging by providing a path to a file to log to.

### --log-rotate

Enable file log rotations with the options of a 1d rotation interval, a maximum of 7 files and with a max file size of 1GB.

### --max-connection

The maximum simultaneous connections allowed to this GraphQL query service expressed as a positive integer. The default value is 10.

### -n, --name

This flag is used to start the query service. If the --subquery-name flag is not provided when running an indexer, the name here will refer to the default project name. If --subquery-name is set, then the name here should match what was set.

```shell
> subql-node -f . // --subquery-name not set

> subql-query -n subql-helloworld  --playground // the name defaults to the project directory name
```

```shell
> subql-node -f . --subquery-name=hiworld // --subquery-name set

> subql-query -n hiworld --playground  // the name points to the subql-helloworld project but with the name of hiworld
```

### --output-fmt

See [--output-fmt](../run_publish/references.md#output-fmt).

### --playground

This flag enables the graphql playground so should always be included by default to be of any use.

### --playground-settings

You can use this flag to pass additional settings to the GraphQL playground (in JSON format). Additional settings can be found here https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground#settings

### --port

The port the subquery query service binds to. By default this is set to `3000`

### --query-complexity

The level of query complexity that this service will accept expressed as a positive integer. By default this is set to 10. If a client makes a query with a query complexity higher than this level, the GraphQL query service will reject the request.

We use the [graphqql-query-complexity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-query-complexity) plugin to calculate this value.

### --query-timeout

The timeout for long running graphql queries expressed in milliseconds, by default this value is 10000 milliseconds

### --subscription

This flag enables [GraphQL Subscriptions](./subscription.md), to enable this feature requires `subql-node` also enable `--subscription`.

### --unsafe (Query Service)

The query service has a limit of 100 entities for unbounded graphql queries. The unsafe flag removes this limit which may cause performance issues on the query service. It is recommended instead that queries are [paginated](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/).

This flag enables certain aggregation functions including sum, max, avg and others. Read more about this feature [here](../run_publish/aggregate.md).

These are disabled by default for database performance reasons.

**Note that must be on a Partner plan if you would like to run projects with the `--unsafe` command (on the query service) within [SubQuery's Managed Service](https://project.subquery.network). Additionally, it will prevent your project from being run in the SubQuery Network in the future.**
