Prior to this, Ian obtained significant experience working on large-scale infrastructure working for Alipay and Yihaodian.com.

### James Bayly - COO and Co-Founder

Well-versed across the business, from product engineering to being the face of SubQuery, James is also a serial entrepreneur leading several tech companies. When he’s not in Berlin sipping cocktails, you’ll find him hiking up the Routeburn Track in New Zealand.

### Scott Twiname - Principal Dev of SDK

Scott has a large wealth of experience in blockchain development. He started out learning about blockchain in his own time and eventually got the opportunity to apply his knowledge as a senior developer at Sylo. He has worked on all facets of blockchain development from smart contracts, dapps, decentralised technologies and wallet integration for various networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos and CENNZnet.

### Marta Adamczyk - Head of Business Development

Marta is a huge tech advocate, Web3 enthusiast and IT-meetup addict. She helps SubQuery customers develop and scale their projects by delivering technical consultancy, developer-oriented content and technical education. Former product evangelist, frontend developer, digital marketer, educator and sales manager with corporate and start-up experience.

### Brittany Seales - Head of Marketing

Brittany has a background in chemistry but since then she became the closest point of contact with SubQuery customers and helped ensure that every SubQuery customer gets an excellent on-boarding experience. Naturally Brittany is heavily integrated with the community and content marketing and has since taken over this area. Sadly, no amount of interaction with successful blockchain projects has give her the ability to pick a winning NFT!
