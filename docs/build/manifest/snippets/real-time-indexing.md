## Real-time indexing (Block Confirmations)

As indexers are an additional layer in your data processing pipeline, they can introduce a massive delay between when an on-chain event occurs and when the data is processed and able to be queried from the indexer.

SubQuery provides real time indexing of unconfirmed data directly from the RPC endpoint that solves this problem. SubQuery takes the most probabilistic data before it is confirmed to provide to the app. In the unlikely event that the data isn’t confirmed and a reorg occurs, SubQuery will automatically roll back and correct its mistakes quickly and efficiently - resulting in an insanely quick user experience for your customers.

To control this feature, please adjust the [--block-confirmations](../../run_publish/references.md#block-confirmations) command to fine tune your project and also ensure that [historic indexing](../../run_publish/references.md#disable-historical) is enabled (enabled by default)
