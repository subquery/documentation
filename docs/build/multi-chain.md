# Multi-Chain Support

Multi-chain indexing allows you to index data from across different networks into the same database, this allows you to query a single endpoint to get data for all supported networks.

You can use the same SubQuery project, which includes the same GraphQL schema and mapping files to achieve this. It means that SubQuery is truly a write once, run anywhere multi-chain indexer.

For example, you could capture XCM transaction data from all Polkadot parachains or monitoring IBC messages across Cosmos Zones in a single project, with a single database, and a single query endpoint.

## How it Works

::: tip Requirements for multi-chain indexing

1. All projects must reference the same [GraphQL schema](./graphql.md) in their `project.yaml`
2. All projects must index to the same PostgreSQL table schema, this is set in your `docker-compose.yml`
3. When you first start your indexing node, you must start it with the `--multi-chain` indexing argument
   :::

You can enable this feature by adding the `--multi-chain` [argument to the node](../run_publish/references.md#multi-chain) (you can do this in the `docker-compose.yml` or when running via command line), this must be done from the start, otherwise you will need to delete and reset your database.

SubQuery will create an individual indexing node for each chain that you index in your SubQuery project. All multi-chain projects must point to the same [GraphQL schema](./graphql.md), ensure that they reference the same file in the individual `project.yaml`.

Finally, the projects should index and save data to the same PostgreSQL database table schema. This will be set in your `docker-compose.yml` with the line `--db-schema=<enter-common-schema-name-here>`. You will need to add this same argument if you are running your project via the command line.

In our example project, we have [altered the standard `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/subquery/multi-networks-transfers/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) to automatically provision two indexing nodes, one for each chain that we are indexing. This is a suggested approach to speed up development.

```yaml
  ...
  subquery-node-polkadot:
    image: onfinality/subql-node:latest
    ...
    command:
      - -f=app/project-polkadot.yaml
      - --multi-chain
      - --db-schema=multi-transfers
      - --disable-historical
    ...
  subquery-node-kusama:
    ...
    command:
      - -f=app/project-kusama.yaml
      - --multi-chain
      - --db-schema=multi-transfers
      - --disable-historical
    ...
```

::: warning Warning
This feature is not compatible with Historical State and will be disabled if `--multi-chain` is used.
:::

::: warning Warning
This feature is only supported for Partner Plan Customers in the [SubQuery Managed Service](https://project.subquery.network). All others can run this locally in their own infrastructure provider.

## Example Project

The repository for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/subquery/multi-networks-transfers), it is an example of a multichain project that indexes multiple networks (in this case Polkadot and Kusama) into the same database.

A modified docker-compose.yaml file has been included, with two subql/node images, one for each network being indexed. You will notice that that each image maps to a seperate manifest file (see [command line references](../run_publish/references.md)).

This multi-chain project can be started regularly by following the [readme](https://github.com/subquery/multi-networks-transfers/blob/main/README.md#configure-your-project)

## Tips

When writing your mapping handlers you should account (or prevent) ID collision. If you think this could be a possibility, it is recommended that you prefix your IDs with the network name/ID.

```ts
// We prefix the ID with the network name to prevent ID collisions across networks
const transfer = new Transfer(
  `${network}-${event.block.block.header.number.toNumber()}-${event.idx}`
);
```

It can also be helpful to save all entities with a property indicating the source network so you can filter like below:

```graphql
query {
  transfers(filter: { network: { equalTo: "polkadot" } }) {
    nodes {
      id
      blockNumber
      network
      amount
    }
  }
}
```

Try to share as much logic as possible across networks, but if you want to determine exactly where the event/transaction/extrinsic/block originated from you will want to define a network specific mapping handler as it's hard to derive exactly what network each input comes from from the input itself.

```ts
// We have two handlers here to allow us to save the correct source network of the transfer
export async function handlePolkadotEvent(e: SubstrateEvent): Promise<void> {
  await handleEvent(e, "polkadot");
}

export async function handleKusamaEvent(e: SubstrateEvent): Promise<void> {
  await handleEvent(e, "kusama");
}

async function handleEvent(
  event: SubstrateEvent,
  network: "polkadot" | "kusama"
): Promise<void> {
  // Do something with shared logic
}
```

In many cases, you will have a completely different set of mapping handlers to deal with the differences of each network/chain that you are indexing.

## Cross-Chain Race Conditions

If you are intending to mutate data across chain, e.g. an action in one network will affect a entity saved from another, then please be aware that SubQuery provides no guarantees of cross-chain ordering.

For example, one chain may index much faster than the other, and when indexing a cross-chain transaction, indexer B may encounter the receipt of this transaction on chain B well before the indexer A encounters that the transaction has been sent on chain A.

We suggest designing your entities to avoid or handle cross-chain race conditions so that chain B can safely record the receipt of the transaction without requiring that chain A has already recorded that the transaction has been sent.

## Querying Metadata

When enabling multi-chain indexing, SubQuery will create multiple metadata tables for each chain that you index. You can individually query these metadata tables using GraphQL using the chainId of the particular network ([see more below](/build/multi-chain.html#querying-metadata)).

When querying metadata using GraphQL with multi-chain enabled, you need to pass the `chainId` (this is set in your `project.yaml`) as shown below:

```graphql
  query {
    _metadata(chainId: '0x91b171bb158e2d3848fa23a9f1c25182fb8e20313b2c1eb49219da7a70ce90c3'){
      lastProcessedHeight
      targetHeight
    }
  }
```
