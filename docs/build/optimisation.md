# Project Optimisation

Performance is a crucial factor in each project. So, how to optimise your Suproject to speed it up?
Fortunately, there are several things you could do to improve it. 

### Common Issues and Top Suggestions

- Avoid using `blockHandlers` where possible. Using block handlers slows your project down as they can be executed with each and every block. Use them only if you need to and [consider adjusting project architecture](#review-project-architecture).
- Always use a [dictionary](../academy/tutorials_examples/dictionary.html#how-does-a-subquery-dictionary-work) (we can help create one for your new network). 
- Try to use filter conditions to reduce the response size. Create filters as specific as possible to avoid querying unnecessary data. 

### Other Improvements 

 Here is the list of further suggestions:

- Query only necessary fields. 
- For large data tables, avoid querying `totalCount` without adding conditions.
- Add indexes to entity fields for query performance, this is especially important for historical projects.
- Set the start block to when the contract was initialised. 
- Optimise your schema design, keep it as simple as possible. 
    - Try to reduce unnecessary fields and columns.
    - Create  indexes as needed.
- Use parallel/batch processing as often as possible. 
    - Use `api.queryMulti()` to optimise Polkadot API calls inside mapping functions and query them in parallel. This is a faster way than a loop.
    - Use `Promise.all()`. In case of multiple async functions, it is better to execute them and resolve in parallel.
    - If you want to create a lot of entities within a single handler, you can use `store.bulkCreate(entityName: string, entities: Entity[])`. You can create them in parallel, no need to do this one by one.
- Making API calls to query state can be slow. You could try to minimise calls where possible and to use `extrinsic/transaction/event` data.
- Use `worker threads` to move block fetching and block processing into its own worker thread. It could speed up indexing by up to 4 times (depending on the particular project). You can easily enable it using the `-workers=<number>` flag. Note that the number of available CPU cores strictly limits the usage of worker threads. For now, it is only available for Substrate and Cosmos and will soon be integrated for Avalanche.
- Note that `JSON.stringify` doesnâ€™t support native `BigInts`. Our logging library will do this internally if you attempt to log an object. We are looking at a workaround for this.
- Use a convenient `modulo` filter to run a handler only once to a specific block. This filter allows handling any given number of blocks, which is extremely useful for grouping and calculating data at a set interval. For instance, if modulo is set to 50, the block handler will run on every 50 blocks. It provides even more control over indexing data to developers.
### Review Project Architecture

If your project requires indexing all the blocks, transactions alongside more specific data, consider dividing it into separate SubQuery projects responsible for different data sources. If such separation is possible it can provide better development experience and efficient workflow. This decision can be compared to a design decision between microservices and monolith project architecture. 

We recommend this approach, because it takes time to index all the blocks and it can slow down your project significantly. If you want to apply some changes to your filters or entities shape you may need to remove your database and reindex the whole project from the beginning.
