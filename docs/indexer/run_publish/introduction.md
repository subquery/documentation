# Run your SubQuery Project

SubQuery is open-source and designed to be easy to run, meaning you have the freedom to run it a variety of ways.

- [Locally on your own computer or on your cloud provider of choice](#locally-run-it-yourself).
- [By publishing it to the decentralised SubQuery Network](#publish-to-the-subquery-network), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers.
- [Leveraging a centralised hosting partner in the SubQuery community](#other-hosting-providers-in-the-subquery-community).

## Locally (Run it yourself)

Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing). There are two ways to run a project locally, using Docker or running the individual components using NodeJS services. [Read more](./run.md). Typically this gives the most flexibility and customisability, but obviously requires effort to maintain and monitor.

## Publish to the SubQuery Network

We're building the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way. After publishing your project to the SubQuery Network, anyone can index and host it - providing data to users around the world faster and reliably. [Read more](../../subquery_network/architects/publish.md).

## Other Hosting Providers in the SubQuery Community

There are a number of external centralised hosting services that offer reliable hosting of production SubQuery data indexing projects. These services are managed by external partners and are designed to make it easy to deploy, manage, and scale your SubQuery projects.
