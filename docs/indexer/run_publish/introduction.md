# Run your SubQuery Project

SubQuery is open-source and designed to be easy to run, meaning you have the freedom to run it a variety of ways.

In short, you will want reliable production ready hosting of your SubQuery project. Typically this means running three services in a stable way:

- A NodeJS indexer service (known as `subql-node`).
- A PostgreSQL database.
- A NodeJS query service (known as `subql-query` or our [subgraph compatible variant](./query/subgraph.md))

There are four key options for how you might run your SubQuery project

## Locally (Run it yourself)

Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing). There are two ways to run a project locally, using Docker or running the individual components using NodeJS services. [Read more](./run.md).

## Using the SubQuery Network

We're building the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way. After publishing your project to the SubQuery Network, anyone can index and host it - providing data to users around the world faster and reliably. [Read more](../../subquery_network/architects/publish.md).

## Other Hosting Providers in the SubQuery Community

There are a number of external centralised hosting services that offer reliable hosting of production SubQuery data indexing projects. These services are managed by external partners and are designed to make it easy to deploy, manage, and scale your SubQuery projects.
