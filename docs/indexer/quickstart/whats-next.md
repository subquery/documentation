# 3. What’s Next?

Now that you have a clear understanding of how to build a basic SubQuery project, what are the next steps of your journey?

SubQuery is open-source and designed to be easy to run, meaning you have the freedom to run it a variety of ways.

- [Locally yourself using your own infrastructure or cloud accounts.](../run_publish/introduction.md#locally-run-it-yourself)
- [On our decentralised SubQuery Network.](../run_publish/introduction.md#using-the-subquery-network)
- [Or with a number of partner hosting services.](../run_publish/introduction.md#other-hosting-providers-in-the-subquery-community)

- To dive deeper into the developer documentation, jump to the [Build ](../build/introduction.md) section and learn more about the three key files: **the manifest file, the GraphQL schema, and the mappings file.**

- If you want to practice with more real examples, then head to our Course section and learn important concepts with related exercises and lab workbooks. Get access to readily available and open-source projects, and get a hands-on experience with SubQuery projects.

- Take a look at some of our **advanced features** to take your project to the next level!

  - [Multi-chain indexing support](../build/multi-chain.md) - SubQuery allows you to index data from across different layer-1 networks into the same database, this allows you to query a single endpoint to get data for all supported networks.
  - [Dynamic Data Sources](../build/dynamicdatasources.md) - When you want to index factory contracts, for example on a DEX or generative NFT project.
  - [GraphQL Subscriptions](../run_publish/query/subscription.md) - Build more reactive front end applications that subscribe to changes in your SubQuery project.

- Find out **how to build a performant SubQuery project and avoid common mistakes** in [Project Optimisation](../build/optimisation.md).

- In the end, if you want to explore more ways to run and publish your project, refer to [Run & Publish section](../run_publish/run.md). Get complete information about all the ways to run your SubQuery project, along with advanced GraphQL aggregation and subscription features.
