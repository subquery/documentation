# 3. What’s Next?

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to build a SubQuery project, what are the next steps of your journey?

## Deployment options
SubQuery is open-source and designed to be easy to run, meaning you have the freedom to run it a variety of ways.

- [Locally yourself using your own infrastructure or cloud accounts.](../run_publish/introduction.md#locally-run-it-yourself)
- [On our decentralised SubQuery Network.](../run_publish/introduction.md#using-the-subquery-network)
- [Or with a number of partner hosting services.](../run_publish/introduction.md#other-hosting-providers-in-the-subquery-community)

## Example projects

Browse over 80 example projects across over 10 network families to inspire your next SubQuery project.

## Advanced features
Dive deeper into the developer documentation and jump to the [Build ](../build/introduction.md) section and learn more about the three key files: **the manifest file, the GraphQL schema, and the mappings file.** or take a look at some of our **advanced features** to take your project to the next level!

  - [Multi-chain indexing support](../build/multi-chain.md) - SubQuery allows you to index data from across different layer-1 networks into the same database, this allows you to query a single endpoint to get data for all supported networks.
  - [Dynamic Data Sources](../build/dynamic-datasources.md) - When you want to index factory contracts, for example on a DEX or generative NFT project.
  - [GraphQL Subscriptions](../run_publish/query/subscription.md) - Build more reactive front end applications that subscribe to changes in your SubQuery project.

- Find out **how to build a performant SubQuery project and avoid common mistakes** in [Project Optimisation](../build/optimisation.md).

Finally, if you want to explore more ways to run and publish your project, refer to [Run & Publish section](../run_publish/run.md). Get complete information about all the ways to run your SubQuery project, along with advanced GraphQL aggregation and subscription features.
