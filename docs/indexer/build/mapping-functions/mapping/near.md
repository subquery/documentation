# NEAR Mapping

Mapping functions define how chain data is transformed into the optimised GraphQL entities that we have previously defined in the `schema.graphql` file.

- Mappings are defined in the `src/mappings` directory and are exported as a function.
- These mappings are also exported in `src/index.ts`.
- The mappings files are reference in `project.ts` under the mapping handlers.
- The mappings are run from within a [Sandbox](./sandbox.md)

There are different classes of mappings functions for NEAR; [Block handlers](#block-handler), [Transaction Handlers](#transaction-handler), and [Action Handlers](#action-handler).

## Block Handler

You can use block handlers to capture information each time a new block is attached to the chain, e.g. block number. To achieve this, a defined BlockHandler will be called once for every block.

**Using block handlers slows your project down as they can be executed with each and every block - only use if you need to.**

```ts
import { NearBlock } from "@subql/types-near";

export async function handleBlock(block: NearBlock): Promise<void> {
  logger.info(`Handling block ${block.header.height}`);

  const blockRecord = NearBlockEntity.create({
    id: block.header.height.toString(),
    hash: block.header.hash,
    author: block.author,
    timestamp: BigInt(block.header.timestamp),
  });

  await blockRecord.save();
}
```

## Transaction Handler

You can use transaction handlers to capture information about each of the transactions in a block. To achieve this, a defined TransactionHandler will be called once for every transaction. You should use [Transaction Filters](../manifest/near.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters) in your manifest to filter transactions to reduce the time it takes to index data and improve mapping performance.

```ts
import { NearTransaction } from "@subql/types-near";

export async function handleTransaction(
  transaction: NearTransaction,
): Promise<void> {
  logger.info(`Handling transaction at ${transaction.block_height}`);

  const transactionRecord = NearTxEntity.create({
    id: `${transaction.block_hash}-${transaction.result.id}`,
    signer: transaction.signer_id,
    receiver: transaction.receiver_id,
  });

  await transactionRecord.save();
}
```

The `NearTransaction` encapsulates transaction info, result, the corresponding block details and the list of `NearAction` entities that occured in the specific transaction.

## Receipt Handler

You can use receipt handlers to capture information about each of the receipts in a block. To achieve this, a defined ReceiptHandler will be called once for every receipt. You should use [Receipt Filters](../manifest/near.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters) in your manifest to filter receipts to reduce the time it takes to index data and improve mapping performance.

```ts
import { NearTransactionReceipt } from "@subql/types-near";

export async function handleReceipt(
  receipt: NearTransactionReceipt,
): Promise<void> {
  logger.info(`Handling receipt at ${receipt.block_height}`);

  const receiptRecord = NearReceiptEntity.create({
    id: `${receipt.block_height}-${receipt.receipt_id}`,
    signer: receipt.Action?.signer_id,
    receiver: receipt.receiver_id,
  });

  await receiptRecord.save();
}
```

The `NearReceipt` encapsulates receipt info, result, the corresponding block details and the list of `NearAction` entities that occured in the specific receipt.

## Action Handler

You can use action handlers to capture information from each action in a transaction. To achieve this, a defined ActionHandler will be called once for every action. You should use [Mapping Filters](../manifest/near.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters) in your manifest to filter actions to reduce the time it takes to index data and improve mapping performance.

```ts
import { NearAction, Transfer } from "@subql/types-near";

export async function handleAction(
  action: NearAction<Transfer>,
): Promise<void> {
  // An Action can belong to either a transaction or a receipt
  // To check which one, we can check if action.transaction is null
  // If it is null, then it belongs to a receipt
  logger.info(
    `Handling action at ${
      action.transaction
        ? action.transaction.block_height
        : action.receipt.block_height
    }`,
  );

  const id = action.transaction
    ? `${action.transaction.block_height}-${action.transaction.result.id}-${action.id}`
    : `${action.receipt.block_height}-${action.receipt.id}-${action.id}`;
  const sender = action.transaction
    ? action.transaction.signer_id
    : action.receipt.predecessor_id;
  const receiver = action.transaction
    ? action.transaction.receiver_id
    : action.receipt.receiver_id;

  const actionRecord = NearActionEntity.create({
    id: id,
    sender: sender,
    receiver: receiver,
    amount: BigInt((action.action as Transfer).deposit.toString()),
    payloadString: JSON.stringify(action.action.args.toJson()),
  });

  await actionRecord.save();
}
```

`NearAction` encapsulates the `action` object containing the action data and the `NearTransaction` or `NearReceipt` in which the action occured in. The payload of the action is stored on the `args`. In many cases, `args` are base64 encoded and JSON formatted, in this case you can use `action.action.args.toJson();` to decode the arguments.

## RPC Calls

We also support some [API RPC methods here](https://github.com/subquery/subql-near/blob/main/packages/types/src/global.ts) that are remote calls that allow the mapping function to interact with the actual node and chain state.

Documents in [NEAR `JsonRpcProvider`](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/reference/classes/providers_json_rpc_provider.JsonRpcProvider.html) provide some methods to interact with the NEAR RPC API.
