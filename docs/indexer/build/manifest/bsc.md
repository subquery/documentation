# BNB Smart Chain (BSC) Manifest File

::: warning Important
We use Ethereum packages, runtimes, and handlers (e.g. `@subql/node-ethereum`, `ethereum/Runtime`, and `ethereum/*Handler`) for BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Since BSC is EVM-compatible, we can use the core Ethereum framework to index it.
:::

The Manifest `project.ts` file can be seen as an entry point of your project and it defines most of the details on how SubQuery will index and transform the chain data. It clearly indicates where we are indexing data from, and to what on chain events we are subscribing to.

The Manifest can be in either Typescript, Yaml, or JSON format.

With the number of new features we are adding to SubQuery, and the slight differences between each chain that mostly occur in the manifest, the project manifest is now written by default in Typescript. This means that you get a fully typed project manifest with documentation and examples provided your code editor.

Below is a standard example of a basic `project.ts`.

```ts
import {
  EthereumProject,
  EthereumDatasourceKind,
  EthereumHandlerKind,

### Schema Spec

| Field    | Type   | Description                              |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **file** | String | The location of your GraphQL schema file |

### Network Spec

If you start your project by using the `subql init` command, you'll generally receive a starter project with the correct network settings. If you are changing the target chain of an existing project, you'll need to edit the [Network Spec](#network-spec) section of this manifest.

The `chainId` is the network identifier of the blockchain. Examples in BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is `56` for mainnet. See https://chainlist.org/chain/56

Additionally you will need to update the `endpoint`. This defines the (HTTP or WSS) endpoint of the blockchain to be indexed - **this must be a full archive node**. This property can be a string or an array of strings (e.g. `endpoint: ['rpc1.endpoint.com', 'rpc2.endpoint.com']`). We suggest providing an array of endpoints as it has the following benefits:

- Increased speed - When enabled with [worker threads](../../run_publish/references.md#w---workers), RPC calls are distributed and parallelised among RPC providers. Historically, RPC latency is often the limiting factor with SubQuery.
- Increased reliability - If an endpoint goes offline, SubQuery will automatically switch to other RPC providers to continue indexing without interruption.
- Reduced load on RPC providers - Indexing is a computationally expensive process on RPC providers, by distributing requests among RPC providers you are lowering the chance that your project will be rate limited.

Public nodes may be rate limited which can affect indexing speed, when developing your project we suggest getting a private API key from a professional RPC provider like [OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/networks/bsc).

## Data Sources and Mapping

In this section, we will talk about the default BSC runtime and its mapping. Here is an example:

```ts
{
  dataSources: [
    {
      kind: EthereumDatasourceKind.Runtime, // Indicates that this is default runtime
      startBlock: 1, // This changes your indexing start block, set this higher to skip initial blocks with less data
      options: {
        // Must be a Record of assets
        abi: "erc20",
        // # this is the contract address for your target contract
        address: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
      },
      assets: new Map([["erc20", { file: "./abis/erc20.abi.json" }]]),
      mapping: {
        file: "./dist/index.js", // Entry path for this mapping
        handlers: [
          /* Enter handers here */
        ],
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

### Mapping Handlers and Filters

The following table explains filters supported by different handlers.

**Your SubQuery project will be much more efficient when you only use `TransactionHandler` or `LogHandler` handlers with appropriate mapping filters (e.g. NOT a `BlockHandler`).**

| Handler                                                              | Supported filter                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ethereum/BlockHandler](../mapping/bsc.md#block-handler)             | `modulo`, `timestamp`                                                                               |
| [ethereum/TransactionHandler](../mapping/bsc.md#transaction-handler) | `function` filters (either be the function fragment or signature), `from` (address), `to` (address) |
| [ethereum/LogHandler](../mapping/bsc.md#log-handler)                 | `topics` filters, and `address`                                                                     |

Default runtime mapping filters are an extremely useful feature to decide what block, event, or extrinsic will trigger a mapping handler.

Only incoming data that satisfies the filter conditions will be processed by the mapping functions. Mapping filters are optional but are highly recommended as they significantly reduce the amount of data processed by your SubQuery project and will improve indexing performance.

The `modulo` filter allows handling every N blocks, which is useful if you want to group or calculate data at a set interval. The following example shows how to use this filter.

```yml
filter:
  modulo: 50 # Index every 50 blocks: 0, 50, 100, 150....
```

## Real-time indexing (Block Confirmations)

As indexers are an additional layer in your data processing pipeline, they can introduce a massive delay between when an on-chain event occurs and when the data is processed and able to be queried from the indexer.

SubQuery provides real time indexing of unconfirmed data directly from the RPC endpoint that solves this problem. SubQuery takes the most probabilistic data before it is confirmed to provide to the app. In the unlikely event that the data isn’t confirmed and a reorg occurs, SubQuery will automatically roll back and correct its mistakes quickly and efficiently - resulting in an insanely quick user experience for your customers.

To control this feature, please adjust the [--block-confirmations](../../run_publish/references.md#block-confirmations) command to fine tune your project and also ensure that [historic indexing](../../run_publish/references.md#disable-historical) is enabled (enabled by default)

## Bypass Blocks

Bypass Blocks allows you to skip the stated blocks, this is useful when there are erroneous blocks in the chain or when a chain skips a block after an outage or a hard fork. It accepts both a `range` or single `integer` entry in the array.

When declaring a `range` use an string in the format of `"start - end"`. Both start and end are inclusive, e.g. a range of `"100-102"` will skip blocks `100`, `101`, and `102`.

```ts
{
  network: {
    bypassBlocks: [1, 2, 3, "105-200", 290];
  }
}
```

## Endpoint Config

This option allows specifying options that are applied specific to an endpoint. This allows you to set headers and the request batch size on a per endpoint basis.

Here is an example of how to set an API key in the header.
```ts
{
  network: {
    endpoint: {
      "wss://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws": {
        headers: {
          "x-api-key": "your-api-key",
        },
        // NOTE: setting this to 0 will not use batch requests
        batchSize: 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```
