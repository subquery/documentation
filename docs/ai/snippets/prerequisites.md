## Prerequisites

In order to run an AI App locally, you must have the following services installed:

- [Docker](https://docker.com/): This tutorial will use Docker to run a local version of SubQuery's node.
- [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/): A recent version of Deno, the JS engine for the SubQuery AI App Framework.

You will also need access to either an Ollama or OpenAI inference endpoint:

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). An endpoint to an Ollama instance, this could be running on your local computer or a commercial endpoint online, or
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com). You will need a paid API Key.
