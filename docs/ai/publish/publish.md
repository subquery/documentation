# Publish your AI App

The SubQuery AI App Framework uses a sandboxed environment for secure and efficient operations. Each AI App is encapsulated with its own manifest, enabling seamless distribution across the SubQuery Network. This ensures that scaling is not only easy but also secure, allowing developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.

:::info AI Apps are in beta

We don't yet support publishing your AI App to the SubQuery Network, but we are working on this right now.

You can continue to build, develop, and self host your AI Apps and soon you will be able to deploy to the decentralised network.
