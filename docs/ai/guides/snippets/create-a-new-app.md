You can initialise a new app using `subql-ai init`. It will ask you to provide a name and a Ollama model to use.

After you complete the initialisation process, you will see a folder with your project name created inside the directory. Please note that there should be three files, a `project.ts`, a `manifest.ts`, a `docker-compose.yml`, and a `README.md`.
