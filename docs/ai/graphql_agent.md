# SubQuery GraphQL Agent

The SubQuery GraphQL Agent is an intelligent AI-powered agent that revolutionizes how users interact with SubQuery and Subgraph projects. Instead of writing complex GraphQL queries manually, users can ask questions in natural language, and the agent will automatically interpret the schema, generate appropriate GraphQL queries, extract the data, and provide summarized answers.

## Overview

Traditional GraphQL query building requires deep understanding of:
- GraphQL schema structure
- Query syntax and best practices
- Entity relationships and data types
- Performance optimization techniques

The GraphQL Agent eliminates these barriers by providing an intelligent interface that bridges the gap between natural language questions and structured data retrieval.

### How It Works

1. **Schema Analysis**: The agent reads and interprets the GraphQL schema of any SubQuery or Subgraph project
2. **Query Generation**: Converts natural language questions into optimized GraphQL queries
3. **Data Extraction**: Executes the queries against the project's endpoint
4. **Intelligent Summarization**: Processes the raw data and provides human-readable answers

## Core Features

### Natural Language to GraphQL Conversion
- Ask questions in plain English: "What are the top 10 DeFi protocols by TVL?"
- Automatic conversion to complex GraphQL queries
- Handles nested queries, filters, and aggregations
- No GraphQL knowledge required

### Innovative Schema Compression Technology
The GraphQL Agent solves a fundamental challenge in AI-powered GraphQL interactions: **schema size exceeds LLM context limits**. Traditional approaches fail because:

- **Traditional**: Full GraphQL introspection schemas are ~50,000+ tokens
- **Our Approach**: Compressed entity schemas are ~500-1,000 tokens (100x smaller)
- **Context Usage**: Reduced from 80-95% to 5-10% of context window
- **Result**: Reliable, cost-effective query generation

### Entity Schema + Rules Architecture
Instead of raw GraphQL schemas, we use a revolutionary **compressed, high-density schema representation**:

1. **Entity Schema**: Project-specific domain models and relationships
2. **PostGraphile v4 Rules**: Query construction patterns for SubQuery SDK
3. **Intelligent Construction**: Agent builds queries using learned patterns
4. **Real-time Validation**: Ensures query correctness before execution

**Benefits:**
- **ðŸ’° Cost Effective**: 10-20x lower token usage than traditional approaches
- **ðŸŽ¯ Higher Accuracy**: Domain-specific knowledge reduces errors
- **âš¡ Faster Responses**: Smaller context means faster processing
- **ðŸ”„ Scalable**: Works consistently across different LLM models

### PostGraphile v4 Pattern Recognition
The agent automatically understands SubQuery SDK-generated GraphQL patterns:
- **Entity Queries**: Single entities and collection queries with pagination
- **Advanced Filtering**: Complex filters with multiple conditions
- **Ordering & Sorting**: Multi-field ordering capabilities
- **Relationship Navigation**: Nested entity relationships

### Multi-Query Orchestration
- Breaks complex questions into multiple related queries
- Executes queries in optimal order
- Combines results from multiple data sources
- Maintains context across related queries

### Data Summarization
- Extracts key insights from large datasets
- Provides human-readable summaries
- Identifies trends and patterns
- Highlights important metrics and relationships

## Technical Reference

### Architecture Overview

The GraphQL Agent is built with these core components:

1. **GraphQLSource** - Connection wrapper for GraphQL endpoints with entity schema support
2. **GraphQLToolkit** - LangChain-compatible toolkit providing all GraphQL tools
3. **Agent Tools** - Individual tools for specific GraphQL operations
4. **FastAPI Server** - OpenAI-compatible API with streaming support

### Available Agent Tools

1. **`graphql_schema_info`** - Get raw entity schema with PostGraphile v4 rules
2. **`graphql_query_validator_execute`** - Combined validation and execution tool (validates queries, then executes them if valid)

### Supported GraphQL Features
- **Queries**: Standard GraphQL queries with fields, arguments, and variables
- **Fragments**: Support for query fragments and inline fragments
- **Aliases**: Field and argument aliasing for custom result structures
- **Directives**: @include and @skip directives for conditional queries
- **Variables**: Query variables for dynamic parameter passing

### PostGraphile v4 Query Patterns

The agent understands these SubQuery SDK patterns automatically:

#### Entity Queries
```graphql
# Single entity
entityName(id: "ID")

# Collection with pagination
entityNames(first: 10, filter: {field: {equalTo: "value"}}) {
  nodes { id, name }
  pageInfo { hasNextPage, endCursor }
}
```

#### Advanced Filtering
```graphql
filter: {
  fieldName: { equalTo: "value" }
  amount: { greaterThan: 100 }
  status: { in: ["active", "pending"] }
}
```

#### Ordering and Pagination
```graphql
orderBy: [FIELD_NAME_ASC, CREATED_AT_DESC]
{
  entities(first: 10, after: "cursor") {
    nodes { id, field }
    pageInfo { hasNextPage, endCursor }
  }
}
```

### Agent Workflow

The agent follows this intelligent workflow:

1. **Relevance Check**: Determines if the question relates to the project data
2. **Schema Analysis**: Loads entity schema and PostGraphile rules (once per session)
3. **Query Construction**: Builds GraphQL queries using PostGraphile patterns
4. **Validation**: Validates queries against the live GraphQL schema
5. **Execution**: Executes validated queries to get real data
6. **Summarization**: Provides user-friendly responses based on actual results
