As evident from the examples above, we employ various handlers for different chains, while keeping the indexed event logs the same. This approach is adopted to facilitate the identification of the originating network for each specific event (refer to this [tip](../../build/multi-chain#handling-network-specific-logic)). This strategy will prove beneficial later, as it allows us to incorporate a `network` field into the entities. This will simplify the execution of filtering, aggregation, and other data manipulation tasks.
