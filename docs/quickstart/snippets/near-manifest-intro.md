For NEAR, there are three types of mapping handlers (and you can have more than one in each project):

- [BlockHandler](../../build/manifest/near.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every block, run a mapping function
- [TransactionHandlers](../../build/manifest/near.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every transaction that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function
- [ActionHandlers](../../build/manifest/near.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every transaction action that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function
