In the earlier section titled "Create a New Project" (refer to [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md)), you should have taken note of three crucial files. To initiate the setup of a project from scratch, you can proceed to follow the steps outlined in the [initialization description](../quickstart.md#2-initialise-a-new-subquery-project). As a prerequisite, you will need to generate types from the ABI files of each smart contract. You can obtain these ABI files by searching for the ABIs of the mentioned smart contract addresses on Etherscan.
