Check out our [Mappings](../../build/mapping/near.md) documentation to get more information on mapping functions.

Navigate to the default mapping function in the `src/mappings` directory. You will be able to see three exported functions: `handleBlock`, `handleAction`, and `handleAction`. Delete both the `handleBlock` and `handleAction` functions as you will only deal with the `handleAction` function.
