In the earlier section titled "Create a New Project" (refer to [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md)), you should have taken note of three crucial files. To initiate the setup of a project from scratch, you can proceed to follow the steps outlined in the [initialisation description](../quickstart.md#2-initialise-a-new-subquery-project). As a prerequisite, you will need to generate types from the ABI files of each smart contract.

Additionally, you can kickstart your project by using the EVM Scaffolding approach (detailed [here](../quickstart.md#evm-project-scaffolding)). You'll find all the relevant events to be scaffolded in the documentation for each type of smart contract.
