# Terra Quick Start

## Goals

The goal of this quick guide is to adapt the standard starter project and start indexing all transfers from Terra.

::: warning Important
Before we begin, make sure that you have initialised your project using the provided steps in the **[Start Here](../quickstart.md)** section.
:::

Now, let's move ahead in the process and update these configurations.

Previously, in the [1. Create a New Project](../quickstart.md) section, you must have noted [3 key files](../quickstart.md#_3-make-changes-to-your-project). Let's begin updating them one by one.

## 1. Update Your GraphQL Schema File

The `schema.graphql` file defines the shape of your data from SubQuery due to the GraphQL query language’s mechanism. Hence, updating the GraphQL Schema file is the perfect start. It allows you to decide your end goal right at the start.

Update the `schema.graphql` file as follows and remove all existing entities, here you can see we are indexing all transfers in Terra:

```graphql
type Transfer @entity {
  id: ID! # id field is always required and must look like this
  txHash: String!
  blockHeight: BigInt # The block height of the transfer
  sender: String! # The account that transfers are made from
  recipient: String! # The account that transfers are made to
  amount: String! # Amount that is transferred
}
```

::: warning Important
When you make any changes to the schema file, do make sure to regenerate your types directory.
:::

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="YARN" active>

```shell
yarn codegen
```

  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="NPM">

```shell
npm run-script codegen
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

You will find the generated models in the `/src/types/models` directory.

Check out the [GraphQL Schema](../../build/graphql.md) documentation to get in-depth information on `schema.graphql` file.

Now that you have made essential changes to the GraphQL Schema file, let’s move forward to the next file.

## 2. Update Your Project Manifest File

The Project Manifest (`project.yaml`) file works as an entry point to your Terra project. It defines most of the details on how SubQuery will index and transform the chain data.

Note that the manifest file has already been set up correctly and doesn’t require significant changes, but you need to change the datasource handlers. This section lists the triggers that look for on the blockchain to start indexing.

**Since you are going to index all Terra transfer events, you need to update the `datasources` section as follows:**

```yaml
dataSources:
  - kind: terra/Runtime
    startBlock: 4724001 # Colombus-5 Starts at this height
    mapping:
      file: ./dist/index.js
      handlers:
        - handler: handleEvent
          kind: terra/EventHandler
          # this will trigger on all events that match the following smart contract filter condition
          filter:
            type: transfer
            messageFilter:
              type: /terra.wasm.v1beta1.MsgExecuteContract
              values:
                # We are subscribing to the bLuna smart contract (e.g. only transfer events from this contract)
                contract: terra1j66jatn3k50hjtg2xemnjm8s7y8dws9xqa5y8w
```

The above code shows that you will be running a `handleEvent` mapping function whenever there is a `transfer` event from the bLuna smart contract.

Check out our [Manifest File](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md) documentation to get more information about the Project Manifest (`project.yaml`) file.

Next, let’s proceed ahead with the Mapping Function’s configuration.

## 3. Add a Mapping Function

Mapping functions define how chain data is transformed into the optimised GraphQL entities that we previously defined in the `schema.graphql` file.

Follow these steps to add a mapping function:

- Navigate to the default mapping function in the `src/mappings` directory. You will be able to see three exported functions: `handleBlock`, `handleEvent`, and `handleCall`. Delete both the `handleBlock` and `handleCall` functions as you will only deal with the `handleEvent` function.

- The `handleEvent` function receives event data whenever an event matches filters, which you specified previously in the `project.yaml`. Let’s make changes to it, process all `transfer` events , and save them to the GraphQL entities created earlier.

Update the `handleEvent` function as follows (**note the additional imports**):

```ts
import { TerraEvent } from "@subql/types-terra";
import { Transfer } from "../types";
import { MsgExecuteContract } from "@terra-money/terra.js";

export async function handleEvent(
  event: TerraEvent<MsgExecuteContract>
): Promise<void> {
  // Print debugging data from the event
  // logger.info(JSON.stringify(event));

  // Create the new transfer entity with a unique ID
  const transfer = new Transfer(
    `${event.tx.tx.txhash}-${event.msg.idx}-${event.idx}`
  );
  transfer.blockHeight = BigInt(event.block.block.block.header.height);
  transfer.txHash = event.tx.tx.txhash;
  for (const attr of event.event.attributes) {
    switch (attr.key) {
      case "sender":
        transfer.sender = attr.value;
        break;
      case "recipient":
        transfer.recipient = attr.value;
        break;
      case "amount":
        transfer.amount = attr.value;
        break;
      default:
    }
  }
  await transfer.save();
}
```

Let’s understand how the above code works.

The function here receives a `TerraEvent` which includes the transfer data on the payload. We extract this data and then instantiate a new `Transfer`entity defined earlier in the `schema.graphql` file. After that, we add additional information and then use the `.save()` function to save the new entity (_Note that SubQuery will automatically save this to the database_).

Check out our [Mappings](../../build/mapping/polkadot.md) documentation to get detailed information on mapping functions.

## 4. Build Your Project

Next, build your work to run your new SubQuery project. Run the build command from the project's root directory as given here:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="YARN" active>

```shell
yarn build
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
  <CodeGroupItem title="NPM">

```shell
npm run-script build
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

::: warning Important
Whenever you make changes to your mapping functions, you must rebuild your project.
:::

Now, you are ready to run your first SubQuery project. Let’s check out the process of running your project in detail.

## 5. Run Your Project Locally with Docker

Whenever you create a new SubQuery Project, you must not forget to run it locally on your computer and test it. Using Docker is the easiest way to do this.

`docker-compose.yml` file defines all the configurations that control how a SubQuery node runs. For a new project, which you have just initialised, you won't need to change anything.

However, visit the [Running SubQuery Locally](../../run_publish/run.md) to get more information on the file and the settings.

Run the following command under the project directory:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="YARN" active>

```shell
yarn start:docker
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
  <CodeGroupItem title="NPM">

```shell
npm run-script start:docker
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

::: info Note
It may take a few minutes to download the required images and start the various nodes and Postgres databases.
:::

## 6. Query Your Project

Next, let's query our project. Follow these three simple steps to query your SubQuery project:

1. Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. You will see a GraphQL playground in the browser and the schemas which are ready to query.

3. Find the _Docs_ tab on the right side of the playground which should open a documentation drawer. This documentation is automatically generated and it helps you find what entities and methods you can query.

Try the following query to understand how it works for your new SubQuery starter project. Don’t forget to learn more about the [GraphQL Query language](../../run_publish/graphql.md).

```graphql
{
  query {
    transfers(first: 10, orderBy: ID_DESC) {
      nodes {
        id
        txHash
        amount
        blockHeight
        sender
        recipient
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What's next?

Congratulations! You have now a locally running SubQuery project that accepts GraphQL API requests for transferring data from bLuna.
