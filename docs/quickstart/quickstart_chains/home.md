# Introduction

Before starting any of the quick start guides, it is important to understand the common steps involved in all projects.

## 1. Update the schema.graphql file

The `schema.graphql` file determines the shape of your data from SubQuery due to the mechanism of the GraphQL query language. Hence, updating the GraphQL Schema file is the perfect place to start. It allows you to define your end goal right at the start.

::: warning Important
When you make any changes to the schema file, please ensure that you regenerate your types directory.
:::


::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn codegen
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script codegen
```

:::

You will find the generated models in the `/src/types/models` directory.

Check out the [GraphQL Schema](../../build/graphql.md) documentation to get in-depth information on `schema.graphql` file.

## 2. Update the project manifest file

The Project Manifest (`project.yaml`) file works as an entry point to your project. It defines most of the details of how SubQuery will index and transform the chain data. Mapping handlers are defined and it is possible to have more than one of each within a project.

## 3. Update the mapping functions

Mapping functions define how chain data is transformed into the optimised GraphQL entities that we previously defined in the `schema.graphql` file.

Check out our [Mappings](../../build/mapping/near.md) documentation to get more information on mapping functions.

## 4. Build your project

Build your work to run your new SubQuery project. Run the build command from the project's root directory as given here:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn build
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script build
```

:::

::: warning Important
Whenever you make changes to your mapping functions, you must rebuild your project.
:::

Now, you are ready to run your first SubQuery project. Letâ€™s check out the process of running your project in detail.

## 5. Run your project locally with docker

Whenever you create a new SubQuery Project, first, you must run it locally on your computer and test it and using Docker is the easiest and quickiest way to do this.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines all the configurations that control how a SubQuery node runs. For a new project, which you have just initialised, you won't need to change anything.

However, visit the [Running SubQuery Locally](../../run_publish/run.md) to get more information on the file and the settings.

Run the following command under the project directory:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn start:docker
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script start:docker
```

::: tip Note
It may take a few minutes to download the required images and start the various nodes and Postgres databases.

## 6. Query your project

Follow these three simple steps to query your SubQuery project:

1. Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. You will see a GraphQL playground in the browser and the schemas which are ready to query.

3. Find the _Docs_ tab on the right side of the playground which should open a documentation drawer. This documentation is automatically generated and it helps you find what entities and methods you can query on.
