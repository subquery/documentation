SubQuery simplifies and ensures type-safety when working with GraphQL entities, smart contracts, events, transactions, and logs. The SubQuery CLI will generate types based on your project's GraphQL schema and any contract ABIs included in the data sources.

<!-- @include: ./codegen.md -->

This action will generate a new directory (or update the existing one) named `src/types`. Inside this directory, you will find automatically generated entity classes corresponding to each type defined in your `schema.graphql`. These classes facilitate type-safe operations for loading, reading, and writing entity fields. You can learn more about this process in [the GraphQL Schema section](../../../build/graphql.md).
