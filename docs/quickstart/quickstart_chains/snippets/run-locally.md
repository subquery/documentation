Whenever you create a new SubQuery Project, first, you must run it locally on your computer and test it and using Docker is the easiest and quickiest way to do this.

## 5. Run Your Project Locally with Docker

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines all the configurations that control how a SubQuery node runs. For a new project, which you have just initialised, you won't need to change anything.

However, visit the [Running SubQuery Locally](../../../run_publish/run.md) to get more information on the file and the settings.

Run the following command under the project directory:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn start:docker
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script start:docker
```

::: tip Note
It may take a few minutes to download the required images and start the various nodes and Postgres databases.
