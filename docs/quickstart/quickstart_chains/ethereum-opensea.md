# Ethereum Quick Start - Opensea (Medium)

Welcome to our comprehensive step-by-step guide dedicated to constructing a SubQuery indexer tailored for the OpenSea marketplace. OpenSea has emerged as a global epicenter for NFTs, establishing itself as a vibrant ecosystem for creators, collectors, and traders alike.

**This guide is designed to seamlessly lead you through the steps of configuring your personal OpenSea SubQuery indexer.**

It's important to note that the indexing process discussed here is designed specifically for the Opensea protocol known as **Seaport**. Seaport represents a groundbreaking web3 marketplace protocol engineered for the secure and efficient buying and selling of NFTs. It's essential to recognize that this protocol extends its utility not solely to OpenSea but to all NFT builders, creators, and collectors. Its core smart contract adheres to open-source principles and operates with inherent decentralization.

## Setting Up the Indexer

In this Seaport indexing project, our main goal is to set up the indexer to only collect information from one smart contract: `0x00000000006c3852cbef3e08e8df289169ede581`, the [SeaportExchange contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000006c3852cbef3e08e8df289169ede581).

For a more comprehensive understanding of how these fundamental protocol mechanisms operate, you can consult the official [Seaport documentation](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview).

<!-- @include: ../snippets/gravatar-note.md -->

<!-- @include: ../snippets/evm-quickstart-reference.md -->

For instance, you can locate the ABI for the main Seaport smart contract at the bottom of [this page](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000006c3852cbef3e08e8df289169ede581#code). Additionally, you can kickstart your project by using the EVM Scaffolding approach (detailed [here](../quickstart.md#evm-project-scaffolding)). You'll find all the relevant events to be scaffolded in the documentation for each type of smart contract.

You only need to set up one handler to index a specific type of log from this contract, which is the `OrderFulfilled` log. Update your manifest file to look like this:

```ts
{
  dataSources: [
    {
      kind: EthereumDatasourceKind.Runtime,
      startBlock: 14946474,

      options: {
        // Must be a key of assets
        abi: "SeaportExchange",
        address: "0x00000000006c3852cbef3e08e8df289169ede581",
      },
      assets: new Map([
        ["SeaportExchange", { file: "./abis/SeaportExchange.abi.json" }],
        ["ERC165", { file: "./abis/ERC165.json" }],
        ["NftMetadata", { file: "./abis/NftMetadata.json" }],
      ]),
      mapping: {
        file: "./dist/index.js",
        handlers: [
          {
            kind: EthereumHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleOrderFulfilled",
            filter: {
              topics: [
                "OrderFulfilled(bytes32,address,address,address,(uint8,address,uint256,uint256)[],(uint8,address,uint256,uint256,address)[])\n",
              ],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Now, let's think about what information we can get from this smart contract for later searching.

```graphql
type Marketplace @entity {
  " Smart contract address of the protocol's main contract (Factory, Registry, etc) "
  id: ID!
  " Number of collections listed on the marketplace. "
  collectionCount: Int!
  ...
  " Sum of marketplaceRevenueETH and creatorRevenueETH. "
  totalRevenueETH: Float!
  " Cumulative unique traders "
  cumulativeUniqueTraders: Int!
}

type Collection @entity {
  " Contract address. "
  id: ID!
  " Collection name, mirrored from the smart contract. Leave null if not available. "
  name: String
  " Collection symbol, mirrored from the smart contract. Leave null if not available. "
  symbol: String
  ...
  " Buyer count. "
  buyerCount: Int!
  " Seller count. "
  sellerCount: Int!
  " Trades of the collection. "
  trades: [Trade!]! @derivedFrom(field: "collection")
}

" Trades exist such as a combination of taker/order and bid/ask. "
type Trade @entity {
  " { Transaction hash }-{ Log index }-{ (optional) ID within bundle } "
  id: ID!
  " Event transaction hash. "
  transactionHash: String!
  ...
  " Collection involved "
  collection: Collection!
  " Stretegy that the trade is executed. "
  strategy: SaleStrategy!
  " Seller account address "
  seller: String!
}

type MarketplaceDailySnapshot @entity {
  " { Contract address }-{# of days since Unix epoch time} "
  id: ID!
  " The marketplace that this snapshot belongs to. "
  marketplace: Marketplace!
  ...
  " Number of traded collections of the day "
  dailyTradedCollectionCount: Int!
  " Number of traded items of the day "
  dailyTradedItemCount: Int!
}

type CollectionDailySnapshot @entity {
  " { Contract address }-{# of days since epoch unix time } "
  id: ID!
  " The collection that this snapshot belongs to. "
  collection: Collection!
  " Block number where the snapshot is taken. "
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  ...
  " Number of traded items of the day "
  dailyTradedItemCount: Int!
}

" A helper entity that maps a trade's order fulfillment method"
type _OrderFulfillment @entity {
  id: ID!
  " The trade being fulfilled"
  trade: Trade!
  " The order filfillment method"
  orderFulfillmentMethod: String
}

" A helper utility entity that works as a set for deduplication purpose. "
type _Item @entity {
  id: ID!
}
```

From the single log we're working with, there's a wealth of information to extract. Notably, there's the `Trade` entity, which signifies the buying and selling activities within a protocol. This entity, as shown in the schema, serves as a link to other entities like `Collection` and `SaleStrategy`. Furthermore, we've included statistical entities, such as `CollectionDailySnapshot` and `MarketplaceDailySnapshot`, to streamline the overall analysis of the protocol's economic dynamics.

<!-- @include: ../snippets/note-on-entity-relationships.md -->

<!-- @include: ../snippets/evm-codegen.md -->

```ts
// Import entity types generated from the GraphQL schema
import {
  Collection,
  CollectionDailySnapshot,
  Marketplace,
  MarketplaceDailySnapshot,
  _OrderFulfillment,
  Trade,
  _Item,
  _OrderFulfillmentMethod,
  NftStandard,
} from "../types";
import { OrderFulfilledLog } from "../types/abi-interfaces/SeaportExchangeAbi";
```

<!-- @include: ../snippets/mapping-intro.md#level4 -->

<!-- @include: ../snippets/ethereum-mapping-note.md -->

Writing mappings for this smart contract is a straightforward process. To provide better context, we've included this handler in a separate file `mapping.ts` within the `src/mappings` directory. Let's start by importing the necessary modules.

```ts
import { OrderFulfilledLog } from "../types/abi-interfaces/SeaportExchangeAbi";
import {
  Collection,
  CollectionDailySnapshot,
  Marketplace,
  MarketplaceDailySnapshot,
  _OrderFulfillment,
  Trade,
  _Item,
  _OrderFulfillmentMethod,
  NftStandard,
} from "../types";
import {
  SpentItemStructOutput,
  ReceivedItemStructOutput,
} from "../types/contracts/SeaportExchange";
import { ERC165__factory } from "../types/contracts/factories/ERC165__factory";
```

`Trade`, `Collection` and other models were created in a [previous step](#2-updating-graphql-schema-file). On the other hand, `OrderFulfilledLog` is a TypeScript model automatically generated by the SubQuery SDK to make it easier to work with events.

As a reminder from the configuration step outlined in the [Manifest File](#1configuring-manifest-file), we have a single handler called `handleOrderFulfilled`. In the context of Seaport indexing, the following code segment illustrates how trade events are handled:

```ts
export async function handleOrderFulfilled(
  event: OrderFulfilledLog,
): Promise<void> {
  // Assert event parameters
  assert(event.args);

  // Extract relevant event data
  const offerer = event.args.offerer;
  const recipient = event.args.recipient;
  const offer = event.args.offer;
  const consideration = event.args.consideration;

  // Attempt to retrieve trade details
  const saleResult = tryGetSale(
    event,
    offerer,
    recipient,
    offer,
    consideration,
  );
  if (!saleResult) {
    return;
  }

  // Calculate trade-related values
  const isBundle = saleResult.nfts.tokenIds.length > 1;
  const collectionAddr = saleResult.nfts.collection.toString();
  const collection = await getOrCreateCollection(collectionAddr);
  const buyer = saleResult.buyer.toString();
  const seller = saleResult.seller.toString();
  const royaltyFee =
    (saleResult.fees.creatorRevenue / saleResult.money.amount) *
    BIGDECIMAL_HUNDRED;
  const totalNftAmount = saleResult.nfts.amounts.reduce(
    (acc, curr) => acc + BigInt(curr.toString()),
    BIGINT_ZERO,
  );
  const volumeETH = saleResult.money.amount / MANTISSA_FACTOR;
  const priceETH = volumeETH / Number(totalNftAmount);

  // Process each trade within the event
  const nNewTrade = saleResult.nfts.tokenIds.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < nNewTrade; i++) {
    const tradeID = isBundle
      ? event.transaction.hash
          .toString()
          .concat("-")
          .concat(event.logIndex.toString())
          .concat("-")
          .concat(i.toString())
      : event.transaction.hash
          .toString()
          .concat("-")
          .concat(event.logIndex.toString());

    // Create a 'Trade' entity for each trade
    const trade = Trade.create({
      // ... Trade details ...
    });
    trade.save();

    // Save trade fulfillment details
    const orderFulfillment = _OrderFulfillment.create({
      // ... Order fulfillment details ...
    });
    orderFulfillment.save();
  }

  // Update collection and marketplace entities
  collection.tradeCount += nNewTrade;
  collection.royaltyFee = royaltyFee;

  // ... (Additional collection and marketplace updates) ...

  // Prepare for updating daily traded item counts
  let newDailyTradedItem = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nNewTrade; i++) {
    // ... Create and save daily traded item entities ...
    newDailyTradedItem++;
  }

  // Take collection and marketplace snapshots
  const collectionSnapshot = await getOrCreateCollectionDailySnapshot(
    collectionAddr,
    event.block.timestamp,
  );

  // ... (Additional snapshot updates) ...

  const marketplaceSnapshot = await getOrCreateMarketplaceDailySnapshot(
    event.block.timestamp,
  );

  // ... (Additional snapshot updates) ...
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how trade events within the Seaport marketplace are processed and indexed. It covers data extraction, calculation, entity creation, and updates to both collection and marketplace entities. This indexing process is essential for tracking and analyzing trade activity within the Seaport protocol.

🎉 At this stage, we have successfully incorporated all the desired entities that can be retrieved from Seaport smart contracts. For each of these entities, we've a single mapping handler to structure and store the data in a queryable format.
