# BSC Quick Start - PancakeSwap

## Goals

PancakeSwap, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) in the web3 ecosystem, relies on indexers to facilitate data retrieval for its user interface, enabling seamless interactions. Indexers like SubQuery systematically organise data related to tokens, liquidity pools, transactions, and other critical information, offering users an efficient and rapid means to search, discover, and analyze data within PancakeSwap.

The main objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on configuring a SubQuery indexer for the PancakeSwap v3 protocol. This guide will encompass all the necessary settings and explore the intricacies of the underlying logic. It serves as an excellent illustration of how to perform indexing for a complex DEX like PancakeSwap.

## Setting Up the Indexer

In this PancakeSwap indexing project, our main focus is on configuring the indexer to exclusively capture logs generated by three specific types of PancakeSwap smart contracts:

1. **PancakeSwapV3Factory** (contract address: `0x0bfbcf9fa4f9c56b0f40a671ad40e0805a091865`): This contract is responsible for creating all the pool smart contracts.

2. **Smart Contracts for Individual Pools**: These contracts represent individual liquidity pools.

3. **NonfungiblePositionManager** (contract address: `0x46a15b0b27311cedf172ab29e4f4766fbe7f4364`): This contract is instrumental in producing liquidity positions, which are implemented as NFTs. This functionality enables additional use-cases, including the transfer of liquidity positions.

To gain a deeper understanding of how these core mechanisms work, you can refer to the official [PancakeSwap documentation](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/developers/smart-contracts/pancakeswap-exchange/v3-contracts).

::: warning Important
We suggest starting with the [Ethereum Gravatar example](./ethereum-gravatar). The Ethereum PancakeSwap project is a lot more complicated and introduces some more advanced concepts
:::

In the earlier section titled "Create a New Project" (refer to [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md)), you should have taken note of three crucial files. To initiate the setup of a project from scratch, you can proceed to follow the steps outlined in the [initialization description](../quickstart.md#2-initialise-a-new-subquery-project). As a prerequisite, you will need to generate types from the ABI files of each smart contract. You can obtain these ABI files by searching for the ABIs of the mentioned smart contract addresses on Etherscan. For instance, you can locate the ABI for **PancakeSwapV3Factory** at the bottom of [this page](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0bfbcf9fa4f9c56b0f40a671ad40e0805a091865#code). Additionally, you can kickstart your project by using the EVM Scaffolding approach (detailed [here](../quickstart.md#evm-project-scaffolding)). You'll find all the relevant events to be scaffolded in the documentation for each type of smart contract, as described in sections [1](#1-configuring-the-manifest-file), [2](#1-configuring-the-manifest-file-1), and [3](#1configuring-the-manifest-file).

::: tip Note
The code snippets provided further have been simplified for clarity. You can find the full and detailed code [here](https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/BNB%20Smart%20Chain/bsc-pancake-swap/) to see all the intricate details.

### PancakeSwapV3Factory

The core role of the factory contract is to generate liquidity pool smart contracts. Each pool comprises a pair of two tokens, uniting to create an asset pair, and is associated with a specific fee rate. It's important to emphasize that multiple pools can exist with the same asset pair, distinguished solely by their unique swap fees.

#### 1.Configuring the Manifest File

In simple terms, there's only one event that requires configuration, and that's the `PoolCreated` event. After adding this event to the manifest file, it will be represented as follows:

```ts
{
  dataSources: [
    {
      kind: EthereumDatasourceKind.Runtime,
      startBlock: 26956207,
      options: {
        // Must be a key of assets
        abi: "Factory",
        address: "0x0bfbcf9fa4f9c56b0f40a671ad40e0805a091865",
      },
      assets: new Map([
        ["Factory", { file: "./abis/factory.json" }],
        ["ERC20", { file: "./abis/ERC20.json" }],

        ["ERC20SymbolBytes", { file: "./abis/ERC20SymbolBytes.json" }],
        ["ERC20NameBytes", { file: "./abis/ERC20NameBytes.json" }],
        ["Pool", { file: "./abis/pool.json" }],
      ]),
      mapping: {
        file: "./dist/index.js",
        handlers: [
          {
            kind: EthereumHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handlePoolCreated",
            filter: {
              topics: [
                "PoolCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, uint24 indexed fee, int24 tickSpacing, address pool)",
              ],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

#### 2. Updating the GraphQL Schema File

Now, let's consider the entities that we can extract from the factory smart contract for subsequent querying. The most obvious ones include:

1. `Factory`: This entity represents the factory smart contracts responsible for creating the `Pool` smart contracts. As of the publication of this page, there is currently only one active factory smart contract in use.

2. `Token`: This entity identifies the token entity, as Pools always involve two tokens.

3. `Pool`: This entity represents the XYK pools, which serve as the primary trading execution mechanism on PancakeSwap V3.

For these entities, the following attributes can be derived from data indexed from raw blockchain logs:

```graphql
type Factory @entity {
  # factory address
  id: ID!
  # amount of pools created
  poolCount: BigInt!
  # amoutn of transactions all time
  txCount: BigInt!

  ...

  # current owner of the factory
  owner: ID!
}

type Token @entity {
  # token address
  id: ID!
  # token symbol
  symbol: String!
  # token name
  name: String!
  # token decimals
  decimals: BigInt!
  # token total supply
  totalSupply: BigInt!

  ...

  # pools token is in that are white listed for USD pricing
  # Should be Pool
  #  whitelistPools: [Pool!]!
  # derived fields
  tokenDayData: [TokenDayData!]! @derivedFrom(field: "token")
}

type Pool @entity {
  # pool address
  id: ID!
  # creation
  createdAtTimestamp: BigInt!
  # block pool was created at
  createdAtBlockNumber: BigInt!
  # token0
  token0: Token
  #  token0: [Token!] @derivedFrom(field: "id")
  token1: Token
  #  token1: [Token!] @derivedFrom(field: "id")
  # current tick
  tick: BigInt
  # current observation index
  observationIndex: BigInt!
  # all time token0 swapped
  volumeToken0: Float!

  ...

  mints: [Mint!]! @derivedFrom(field: "pool")
  burns: [Burn!]! @derivedFrom(field: "pool")
  swaps: [Swap!]! @derivedFrom(field: "pool")
  collects: [Collect!]! @derivedFrom(field: "pool")
  ticks: [Tick!]! @derivedFrom(field: "pool")
}

```

::: tip Note
The attributes mentioned above represent only a subset of the available attributes. For a complete list and detailed documentation, please refer to the final code.
:::

As you explore these attributes, you may notice the relationship between the `Pool` and `Token` entities. Additionally, you'll find numerous derived attributes like `mints` or `swaps`.

::: tip Note
Importantly, these relationships not only establish one-to-many connections but also extend to include many-to-many associations. To delve deeper into entity relationships, you can refer to [this section](../../build/graphql.md#entity-relationships). If you prefer a more example-based approach, our dedicated [Hero Course Module](../../academy/herocourse/module3.md) can provide further insights.
:::

SubQuery simplifies and ensures type-safety when working with GraphQL entities, smart contracts, events, transactions, and logs. The SubQuery CLI will generate types based on your project's GraphQL schema and any contract ABIs included in the data sources.

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn codegen
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script codegen
```

:::

This action will generate a new directory (or update the existing one) named `src/types`. Inside this directory, you will find automatically generated entity classes corresponding to each type defined in your `schema.graphql`. These classes facilitate type-safe operations for loading, reading, and writing entity fields. You can learn more about this process in [the GraphQL Schema section](../../build/graphql.md).

You can conveniently import all these entities from the following directory:

```ts
// Import entity types generated from the GraphQL schema
import { Factory, Pool, Token } from "../types";
```

It will also generate a class for every contract event, offering convenient access to event parameters, as well as information about the block and transaction from which the event originated. You can find detailed information on how this is achieved in the [EVM Codegen from ABIs](../../build/introduction.md#evm-codegen-from-abis) section. All of these types are stored in the `src/types/abi-interfaces` and `src/types/contracts` directories.

#### 3. Writing the Mappings

Mapping functions define how blockchain data is transformed into the optimized GraphQL entities that we previously defined in the `schema.graphql` file.

::: tip Note
For more information on mapping functions, please refer to our [Mappings](../../build/mapping/ethereum.md) documentation.
:::

Writing mappings for the factory smart contract is a straightforward process. To provide better context, we've included this handler in a separate file `factory.ts` within the `src/mappings` directory. Let's start by importing the necessary modules.

```ts
// Import event types from the registry contract ABI
import {
  Pool,
  Token,
  Factory,
  ...
} from "../types";
import { EthereumLog } from "@subql/types-ethereum";
import { PoolCreatedEvent } from "../types/contracts/Factory";
```

`Pool`, `Factory`, and `Token` are models that were generated in a [prior step](#2-updating-graphql-schema-file). `PoolCreatedEvent` and `EthereumLog` are TypeScript models generated by the SubQuery SDK to facilitate event handling.

As a reminder from the configuration step outlined in the [Manifest File](#1configuring-manifest-file), we have a single handler called `handlePoolCreated`. Now, let's proceed with its implementation:

```ts
export async function handlePoolCreated(
  event: EthereumLog<PoolCreatedEvent["args"]>
): Promise<void> {
  let factory = await Factory.get(FACTORY_ADDRESS);
  if (factory === undefined || factory === undefined) {
    factory = Factory.create({
      id: FACTORY_ADDRESS,
      poolCount: ZERO_BI,
      totalVolumeETH: 0,
      ...
  }

  let [token0, token1] = await Promise.all([
    Token.get(event.args.token0),
    Token.get(event.args.token1),
  ]);
  // fetch info if nul
  if (token0 === undefined || token0 == null) {
    const [symbol, name, totalSupply, decimals] = await Promise.all([
      fetchTokenSymbol(event.args.token0),
      fetchTokenName(event.args.token0),
      fetchTokenTotalSupply(event.args.token0).then((r) => r.toBigInt()),
      fetchTokenDecimals(event.args.token0),
    ]);
    // bail if we couldn't figure out the decimals
    if (!decimals) {
      return;
    }

    token0 = Token.create({
      id: event.args.token0,
      symbol,
      name,
      totalSupply,
      ...
    });
  }

  if (token1 === undefined || token1 == null) {
    const [symbol, name, totalSupply, decimals] = await Promise.all([
      fetchTokenSymbol(event.args.token1),
      fetchTokenName(event.args.token1),
      fetchTokenTotalSupply(event.args.token1).then((r) => r.toBigInt()),
      fetchTokenDecimals(event.args.token1),
    ]);
    // bail if we couldn't figure out the decimals
    if (!decimals) {
      return;
    }

    token1 = Token.create({
      id: event.args.token1,
      symbol,
      name,
      totalSupply,
      ...
    });
  }

  factory.poolCount = factory.poolCount + ONE_BI;

  const pool = Pool.create({
    id: event.args.pool,
    token0Id: token0.id,
    token1Id: token1.id,
    ...
  });

  await Promise.all([
    token0.save(),
    token1.save(), // create the tracked contract based on the template
    pool.save(),
    factory.save(),
  ]);
}
```

Explaining the code provided above, the `handlePoolCreated` function accepts an Ethereum event object as its input. This function serves the purpose of capturing essential information when a new pool is created on the blockchain. Here's a breakdown of its key steps:

1. **Factory Object Retrieval**: Initially, the function tries to retrieve a Factory object. If a Factory object is not found or is undefined, it proceeds to create a new Factory object with default initial values.

2. **Token Information Retrieval**: Following that, the function fetches information about two tokens: `token0` and `token1`.

::: tip Note
Throughout this mapping and those that follow, numerous utility functions are employed to process the data. In this specific example, these utility functions are stored in the `utils` directory. If you're interested in understanding how they work, you can refer to the [final code](https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/BNB%20Smart%20Chain/bsc-pancake-swap/).
:::

3. **Data Persistence**: To ensure the collected data persists, the function saves the modifications made to the `Token`, `Pool`, and `Factory` objects. This typically entails storing the data in a database or data store.

🎉 At this point, you have successfully crafted the handling logic for the factory smart contract and populated queryable entities like `Token`, `Pool`, and `Factory`. This means you can now proceed to the [building process](#build-your-project) to test the indexer's functionality up to this point.

### Pool Smart Contracts

As we discussed in the introduction of [Configuring the Indexer](#configuring-the-indexer), a new contract is created by the [factory contract](#pancakeswapv3factory) for each newly created pool.

#### 1. Configuring the Manifest File

The contract factory generates fresh contract instances for each new pool, therefore we use [dynamic data sources](../../build/dynamicdatasources.md) to create indexers for each new contract:

```ts
{
   templates: [
    {
      kind: EthereumDatasourceKind.Runtime,
      name: "Pool",
      options: {
        abi: "Pool",
      },
      assets: new Map([
        ["Pool", { file: "./abis/pool.json" }],
        ["ERC20", { file: "./abis/ERC20.json" }],
        ["Factory", { file: "./abis/factory.json" }],
      ]),
      mapping: {
        file: "./dist/index.js",
        handlers: [
          {
            kind: EthereumHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleInitialize",
            filter: {
              topics: ["Initialize (uint160,int24)"],
            },
          },
          {
            kind: EthereumHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleSwap",
            filter: {
              topics: [
                "Swap (address sender, address recipient, int256 amount0, int256 amount1, uint160 sqrtPriceX96, uint128 liquidity, int24 tick)",
              ],
            },
          },
          {
            kind: EthereumHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleMint",
            filter: {
              topics: [
                "Mint(address sender, address owner, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 amount, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)",
              ],
            },
          },
          {
            kind: EthereumHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleBurn",
            filter: {
              topics: [
                "Burn(indexed address,indexed int24,indexed int24,uint128,uint256,uint256)",
              ],
            },
          },
          {
            kind: EthereumHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleFlash",
            filter: {
              topics: [
                "Flash(indexed address,indexed address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)",
              ],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

#### 2. Updating the GraphQL Schema File

Numerous entities can be derived from each newly created pool smart contract. To highlight some of the most crucial ones, you'll need to extend the `schema.graphql` file with the following entities:

```graphql
type Mint @entity {
  # transaction hash + "#" + index in mints Transaction array
  id: ID!
  # which txn the mint was included in
  transaction: Transaction!
  # time of txn
  timestamp: BigInt!
  # pool position is within
  pool: Pool!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token0: Token!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token1: Token!
  ...
  # order within the txn
  logIndex: BigInt
}

type Burn @entity {
  # transaction hash + "#" + index in mints Transaction array
  id: ID!
  # txn burn was included in
  transaction: Transaction!
  # pool position is within
  pool: Pool!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token0: Token!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token1: Token!
  ...
  # position within the transactions
  logIndex: BigInt
}

type Swap @entity {
  # transaction hash + "#" + index in swaps Transaction array
  id: ID!
  # pointer to transaction
  transaction: Transaction!
  # timestamp of transaction
  timestamp: BigInt!
  # pool swap occured within
  pool: Pool!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token0: Token!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token1: Token!
  ...
  # index within the txn
  logIndex: BigInt
}

type Collect @entity {
  # transaction hash + "#" + index in collect Transaction array
  id: ID!
  # pointer to txn
  transaction: Transaction!
  # timestamp of event
  timestamp: BigInt!
  # pool collect occured within
  pool: Pool!
  ...
  # index within the txn
  logIndex: BigInt
}

type Flash @entity {
  # transaction hash + "-" + index in collect Transaction array
  id: ID!
  # pointer to txn
  transaction: Transaction!
  # timestamp of event
  timestamp: BigInt!
  # pool collect occured within
  pool: Pool!
  ...
  # index within the txn
  logIndex: BigInt
}

type Transaction @entity {
  # txn hash
  id: ID!
  # block txn was included in
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  # timestamp txn was confirmed
  timestamp: BigInt!
  # gas used during txn execution
  gasUsed: BigInt!
  gasPrice: BigInt!
  # derived values
  mints: [Mint]! @derivedFrom(field: "transaction")
  burns: [Burn]! @derivedFrom(field: "transaction")
  swaps: [Swap]! @derivedFrom(field: "transaction")
  flashed: [Flash]! @derivedFrom(field: "transaction")
  collects: [Collect]! @derivedFrom(field: "transaction")
}

```

Similar to the previously imported entities, we observe various relationships here. In this case, each new entity references both the `Token` and `Pool` entities, establishing a one-to-one relationship. Additionally, each new entity references a `Transaction` entity, which is the only one among the newly added entities not derived from logs. Instead, it's derived from an event to a specific transaction, showcasing the capabilities of the Subquery SDK.

Now, the next step involves instructing the SubQuery CLI to generate types based on your project's updated GraphQL schema:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn codegen
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script codegen
```

:::

This will create update the existing `src/types` directory. All new entites can now be imported from the following directory:

```ts
import { Burn, Mint, Swap } from "../types";
import {
  InitializeEvent,
  MintEvent,
  BurnEvent,
  SwapEvent,
  FlashEvent,
} from "../types/contracts/Pool";
```

#### 3. Writing the Mappings

In this scenario, the mapping process involves two substeps:

##### Enabling Handling of Newly Created Smart Contracts

To ensure that all the events mentioned above are handled for any newly created pool smart contract, you'll need to make a minor update to the code in the [factory contract mapping](#3-writing-the-mappings) `factory.ts` file. Once you've executed `subql codegen`, you can include the following import in that file:

```ts
import { createPoolDatasource } from "../types";
```

Then, within `handlePoolCreated` you will have to add the following:

```ts
await createPoolDatasource({
  address: event.args.pool,
});
```

After adding the above code to the handler of factory smart contract, you can be sure that the manifested events of all the smart contracts that it produce will be handled.

##### Writing Pool Smart Contracts Handlers

The mapping functions for the new entities are a much longer, therefore, in this example, we will only partially incorporate the mapping of `handleSwap` handler:

```ts
export async function handleSwap(
  event: EthereumLog<SwapEvent["args"]>
): Promise<void> {
  const poolContract = Pool__factory.connect(event.address, api);
  const [
    factory,
    pool,
    transaction,
    ethPrice,
    feeGrowthGlobal0X128,
    feeGrowthGlobal1X128,
  ] = await Promise.all([
    Factory.get(FACTORY_ADDRESS),
    Pool.get(event.address),
    loadTransaction(event),
    getEthPriceInUSD(),
    poolContract.feeGrowthGlobal0X128(),
    poolContract.feeGrowthGlobal1X128(),
  ]);

  const [token0, token1] = await Promise.all([
    Token.get(pool.token0Id),
    Token.get(pool.token1Id),
  ]);
  const oldTick = pool.tick;

  ...

  // global updates
  factory.txCount = factory.txCount + ONE_BI; //BigNumber.from(factory.txCount).add(ONE_BI).toBigInt()
  factory.totalVolumeETH =
    factory.totalVolumeETH + amountTotalETHTracked.toNumber(); //BigNumber.from(factory.totalVolumeETH).add(amountTotalETHTracked).toNumber()

  // updated pool ratess
  const prices = sqrtPriceX96ToTokenPrices(pool.sqrtPrice, token0, token1);

  pool.token0Price = prices[0];
  pool.token1Price = prices[1];

  // create Swap event
  // const transaction = await loadTransaction(event)
  const swap = Swap.create({
    id: transaction.id + "#" + pool.txCount.toString(),
    transactionId: transaction.id,
    timestamp: transaction.timestamp,
    poolId: pool.id,
    token0Id: pool.token0Id,
    token1Id: pool.token1Id,
    sender: event.args.sender,
    origin: event.transaction.from,
    recipient: event.args.recipient,
    amount0: amount0.toNumber(),
    amount1: amount1.toNumber(),
    amountUSD: amountTotalUSDTracked.toNumber(),
    tick: BigInt(event.args.tick),
    sqrtPriceX96: event.args.sqrtPriceX96.toBigInt(),
    logIndex: BigInt(event.logIndex),
  });

  await Promise.all([
    swap.save(),
    factory.save(),
    pool.save(),
    token0.save(),
    token1.save(),
  ]);
}

```

To provide a quick overview of the code above: the function is named `handleSwap` and accepts an Ethereum event object (`event`) as its parameter. It then proceeds to execute several asynchronous operations concurrently using `Promise.all()`. These operations involve fetching data related to the factory, pool, transaction, Ethereum price in USD, and fee growth data from the pool contract. Similarly to the previous step, this code retrieves information about two tokens (`token0` and `token1`) based on their IDs stored in the pool object.

The code also performs updates to specific global statistics associated with the factory. This includes incrementing the transaction count (`txCount`) and the total volume of ETH traded based on the data acquired during the swap event.

::: tip Note
For simplicity's sake, we won't delve into a comprehensive explanation of the global statistics metrics. However, in the [final code](https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/BNB%20Smart%20Chain/bsc-pancake-swap/), you'll find entities with names like `PoolDayData`, `PoolHourData`, `TickHourData`, `TickDayData`, and `TokenHourData`, and their names provide self-explanatory context.
:::

Furthermore, the code calculates and updates token prices within the pool using the square root price (`sqrtPrice`) of the pool and the tokens involved in the swap. A new `Swap` event object is generated to record the details of the swap transaction.

Finally, the function saves the updated data for the swap, factory, pool, token0, and token1 objects to ensure that the changes persist in a database or data store.

🎉 At this stage, you've crafted handling logic for both the factory smart contract and all the pools smart contracts it creates. Additionally, you've populated the project with more entities like `Swap`, `Burn`, and `Mint`, making them queryable. Once again, you can proceed to the [building process](#build-your-project) to test how the indexer operates up to this point.

### NonfungiblePositionManager

As you may already know, swaps in PancakeSwap V3 are executed within the context of pools. To enable swaps, these pools must be liquid, and users provide liquidity to each specific pool. Each liquidity provision results in a Liquidity Position, essentially an NFT. This design enables a broader range of DeFi use cases. And the contract responsible for managing these provisions is known as the NonfungiblePositionManager.

#### 1. Configuring the Manifest File

For the NonfungiblePositionManager smart contract, we want to introduce the following updates to the manifest file:

```ts
{
  dataSources: [
     {
      kind: EthereumDatasourceKind.Runtime,
      startBlock: 26931961,

      options: {

The configuration process closely resembles what we've seen earlier. However, we now have a completely new smart contract that we'll be handling events from. This entails different ABI, address, and start block values. Naturally, it also introduces new events, which are listed under the `handlers` object.

#### 2. Updating the GraphQL Schema File

From this smart contract, the only new entity we'll emphasize is the `Position`:

```graphql
type Position @entity {
  # Positions created through NonfungiblePositionManager
  # NFT token id
  id: ID!
  # owner of the NFT
  owner: String!
  # pool position is within
  pool: Pool!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token0: Token!
  # allow indexing by tokens
  token1: Token!
  ...
  # tx in which the position was initialized
  transaction: Transaction!
  # vars needed for fee computation
  feeGrowthInside0LastX128: BigInt!
  feeGrowthInside1LastX128: BigInt!
}
```

Once more, we encounter connections to various entities like `Pool` and `Token`.

Now, the next step involves instructing the SubQuery CLI to generate types based on your project's updated GraphQL schema:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn codegen
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script codegen
```

:::

This will create update the existing `src/types` directory. All new entites can now be imported from the following directory:

```ts
import { Position } from "../types";
import {
  IncreaseLiquidityEvent,
  DecreaseLiquidityEvent,
  CollectEvent,
  TransferEvent,
} from "../types/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager";
```

#### 3. Writing the Mappings

For this contract, we will craft the mappings in a file named `position-manager.ts`. Once again, this separation provides context and clarity.

The mapping functions in this file can be extensive. In this example, we will provide a partial implementation of the mapping for the `handleIncreaseLiquidity` handler:

```ts
export async function handleIncreaseLiquidity(
  event: EthereumLog<IncreaseLiquidityEvent["args"]>
): Promise<void> {
  const position = await getPosition(event, event.args.tokenId);

  const [token0, token1] = await Promise.all([
    Token.get(position.token0Id),
    Token.get(position.token1Id),
  ]);

  await updateFeeVars(position, event, event.args.tokenId);

  await position.save();

  await savePositionSnapshot(position, event);
}

async function getPosition(
  event: EthereumLog,
  tokenId: BigNumber
): Promise<Position> | null {
  let position = await Position.get(tokenId.toString());

  if (position === undefined) {
    const contract = NonfungiblePositionManager__factory.connect(
      event.address,
      api
    );
    let positionResult;
    try {
      positionResult = await contract.positions(tokenId);
    } catch (e) {
      logger.warn(
        `Contract ${event.address}, could not get position with tokenId ${tokenId}`
      );
      return null;
    }

    const [poolAddress, transaction] = await Promise.all([
      factoryContract.getPool(
        positionResult[2],
        positionResult[3],
        positionResult[4]
      ),
      loadTransaction(event),
    ]);
    position = Position.create({
      id: tokenId.toString(),
      owner: ADDRESS_ZERO,
      poolId: poolAddress,
      token0Id: positionResult[2],
      token1Id: positionResult[3],
      tickLowerId: `${poolAddress}#${positionResult[5].toString()}`,
      tickUpperId: `${poolAddress}#${positionResult[6].toString()}`,
      liquidity: ZERO_BI,
      depositedToken0: 0, //ZERO_BD.toNumber(),
      depositedToken1: 0, //ZERO_BD.toNumber(),
      withdrawnToken0: 0, //ZERO_BD.toNumber(),
      withdrawnToken1: 0, //ZERO_BD.toNumber(),
      collectedFeesToken0: 0, //ZERO_BD.toNumber(),
      collectedFeesToken1: 0, //ZERO_BD.toNumber(),
      transactionId: transaction.id,
      feeGrowthInside0LastX128: positionResult[8].toBigInt(),
      feeGrowthInside1LastX128: positionResult[9].toBigInt(),
    });
  }
  return position;
}
```

To briefly clarify the code provided above: the handler function `handleIncreaseLiquidity` is responsible for managing an increase in liquidity event on the blockchain. Initially, it invokes the `getPosition` function to either retrieve an existing liquidity position associated with the event's `tokenId` or create a new one if necessary. Any modifications made to the `Position` object during this process are saved to ensure persistence.

🎉 In conclusion, we have successfully incorporated all the desired entities that can be retrieved from various smart contracts. For each of these entities, we've created mapping handlers to structure and store the data in a queryable format.

::: tip Note

## Build Your Project

Next, build your work to run your new SubQuery project. Run the build command from the project's root directory as given here:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn build
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script build
```

:::

::: warning Important
Whenever you make changes to your mapping functions, you must rebuild your project.
:::

Now, you are ready to run your first SubQuery project. Let’s check out the process of running your project in detail.

## Run Your Project Locally with Docker

Whenever you create a new SubQuery Project, first, you must run it locally on your computer and test it and using Docker is the easiest and quickiest way to do this.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines all the configurations that control how a SubQuery node runs. For a new project, which you have just initialised, you won't need to change anything.

However, visit the [Running SubQuery Locally](../../run_publish/run.md) to get more information on the file and the settings.

Run the following command under the project directory:

::: code-tabs
@tab:active yarn

```shell
yarn start:docker
```

@tab npm

```shell
npm run-script start:docker
```

:::

::: tip Note
It may take a few minutes to download the required images and start the various nodes and Postgres databases.
:::

## Query your Project

Next, let's query our project. Follow these three simple steps to query your SubQuery project:

1. Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. You will see a GraphQL playground in the browser and the schemas which are ready to query.

3. Find the _Docs_ tab on the right side of the playground which should open a documentation drawer. This documentation is automatically generated and it helps you find what entities and methods you can query.

Try the following queries to understand how it works for your new SubQuery starter project. Don’t forget to learn more about the [GraphQL Query language](../../run_publish/query.md).
