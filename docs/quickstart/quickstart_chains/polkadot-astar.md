# Astar (WASM) Quick Start

This quick start guide introduces SubQuery's Substrate WASM support by using an example project in Astar Network. The example project indexes all Transactions and Approvals from the [Astar Wasm based lottery contract](https://astar.subscan.io/account/bZ2uiFGTLcYyP8F88XzXa13xu5Mmp13VLiaW1gGn7rzxktc), as well as dApp staking events from [Astar's dApp Staking](https://docs.astar.network/docs/dapp-staking/) functions.

::: tip Note

The final code of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/subquery/subql-starter/tree/main/Astar/astar-wasm-starter).

:::

This project is unique, as it indexes data from both Astar's Substrate execution layer (native Astar pallets and runtime), with smart contract data from Astar's WASM smart contract layer, within the same SubQuery project and into the same dataset. A very similar approach can be take with indexing Astar's EVM layer too.

<!-- @include: ../snippets/quickstart-reference.md -->

<!-- @include: ../snippets/schema-intro.md#level2 -->

The Astar-wasm-starter project has four entities. A Transaction, Approval, DApp, and DAppReward (which has a [foreign key](../../build/graphql.md#one-to-many-relationships) to Dapp). These index basic block data such as the timestamp, heigh and hash along with from and contract addresses and the value.

```graphql
type Transaction @entity {
  id: ID! # Transaction hash
  transactionHash: String
  blockHeight: BigInt
  blockHash: String
  timestamp: Date
  value: BigInt
  from: String!
  to: String!
  contractAddress: String!
}

type Approval @entity {
  id: ID! # Transaction hash
  blockHeight: BigInt
  value: BigInt
  hash: String
  owner: String!
  spender: String!
  contractAddress: String!
}

type DApp @entity {
  id: ID! #EVM is a required field
  accountID: String!
  totalStake: BigInt!
}

type DAppReward @entity {
  id: ID!
  dApp: DApp!
  accountID: String!
  eraIndex: Int!
  balanceOf: BigInt!
}
```

## The Project Manifest File

The Project Manifest (`project.ts`) file works as an entry point to your project. It defines most of the details on how SubQuery will index and transform the chain data. For Substrate/Polkadot chains, there are three types of mapping handlers:

- [BlockHanders](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every block, run a mapping function
- [EventHandlers](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every Event that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function
- [CallHanders](../../build/manifest/polkadot.md#mapping-handlers-and-filters): On each and every extrinsic call that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function

For [EVM](../../build/substrate-evm.md) and [WASM](../../build/substrate-wasm.md) data processors on Substrate/Polkadot chains, there are only two types of mapping handlers:

- [EventHandlers](../../build/substrate-wasm.html#event-handlers): On each and every Event that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function
- [CallHanders](../../build/substrate-wasm.html#call-handlers): On each and every extrinsic call that matches optional filter criteria, run a mapping function

### Substrate Manifest section

**Since we are planning to index all Polkadot transfers, we need to update the `datasources` section as follows:**

```ts
{
  dataSources: [
    {
      // This is the datasource for Astar's Native Substrate processor
      kind: SubstrateDatasourceKind.Runtime,
      startBlock: 87073,
      mapping: {
        file: "./dist/index.js",
        handlers: [
          {
            kind: SubstrateHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleNewContract",
            filter: {
              module: "dappsStaking",
              method: "NewContract",
            },
          },
          {
            kind: SubstrateHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleBondAndStake",
            filter: {
              module: "dappsStaking",
              method: "BondAndStake",
            },
          },
          {
            kind: SubstrateHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleUnbondAndUnstake",
            filter: {
              module: "dappsStaking",
              method: "UnbondAndUnstake",
            },
          },
          {
            kind: SubstrateHandlerKind.Event,
            handler: "handleReward",
            filter: {
              module: "dappsStaking",
              method: "Reward",
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

This indicates that you will be running a `handleNewContract` mapping function whenever there is an event emitted from the `NewContract` method on the `dappsStaking` pallet. Similarly we will run other mapping functions for the three other events being emitted from the `dappsStaking` to other mapping functions. This covers most interactions with the dApp staking feature that we are interested in.

### WASM Manifest Section

If you're not using the [WASM starter template](https://github.com/subquery/subql-starter/tree/main/Astar/astar-wasm-starter) then please add the Wasm Datasource as a dependency using `yarn add @subql/substrate-wasm-processor`.

We are indexing all transfers and approve contract call events from the Astar contract `bZ2uiFGTLcYyP8F88XzXa13xu5Mmp13VLiaW1gGn7rzxktc`. First, you will need to import the contract ABI defintion. You can copy the entire JSON and save it as a file `./erc20Metadata.abi.json` in the `abis` directory.

This section in the Project Manifest now imports all the correct definitions and lists the triggers that we look for on the blockchain when indexing. We add another section the datasource beneath the above [substrate manifest section](#substrate-manifest-section).

```ts
{
  dataSources: [
    {
      // This is the datasource for Astar's Wasm processor
      kind: "substrate/Wasm",
      startBlock: 3281780,
      processor: {
        file: "./node_modules/@subql/substrate-wasm-processor/dist/bundle.js",
        options: {
          abi: "erc20",
          // contract: "a6Yrf6jAPUwjoi5YvvoTE4ES5vYAMpV55ZCsFHtwMFPDx7H" // Shibuya
          contract: "bZ2uiFGTLcYyP8F88XzXa13xu5Mmp13VLiaW1gGn7rzxktc", // Mainnet,
        },
      },
      assets: new Map([["erc20", { file: "./abis/erc20Metadata.abi.json" }]]),
      mapping: {
        file: "./dist/index.js",
        handlers: [
          {
            handler: "handleWasmEvent",
            kind: "substrate/WasmEvent",
            filter: {
              // contract: "a6Yrf6jAPUwjoi5YvvoTE4ES5vYAMpV55ZCsFHtwMFPDx7H" // Shibuya
              contract: "bZ2uiFGTLcYyP8F88XzXa13xu5Mmp13VLiaW1gGn7rzxktc", // Mainnet
              identifier: "Transfer",
            },
          },
          {
            handler: "handleWasmCall",
            kind: "substrate/WasmEvent",
            filter: {
              selector: "0x681266a0",
              method: "approve",
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

The above code indicates that you will be running a `handleWasmEvent` mapping function whenever there is an `Transfer` event on any transaction from the Astar contract. Similarly, we will run the `handleWasmCall` mapping function whenever there is a `approve` log on the same contract.

Check out our [Substrate Wasm](../../build/substrate-wasm.md) documentation to get more information about the Project Manifest (`project.ts`) file for Substrate WASM contracts.

<!-- @include: ../snippets/mapping-intro.md#level2 -->

Navigate to the default mapping function in the `src/mappings` directory. There are multiple other exported functions such as `handleWasmCall`, `handleWasmEvent`, `handleNewContract`, `handleBondAndStake`, `handleUnbondAndUnstake`, and `handleReward`.

```ts
type ApproveCallArgs = [AccountId, Balance];

export async function handleWasmCall(
  call: WasmCall<ApproveCallArgs>,
): Promise<void> {
  logger.info(`Processing WASM Call at ${call.blockNumber}`);
  const approval = new Approval(`${call.blockNumber}-${call.idx}`);
  approval.hash = call.hash;
  approval.owner = call.from.toString();
  approval.contractAddress = call.dest.toString();
  if (typeof call.data !== "string") {
    const [spender, value] = call.data.args;
    approval.spender = spender.toString();
    approval.value = value.toBigInt();
  } else {
    logger.info(`Decode call failed ${call.hash}`);
  }
  await approval.save();
}
```

The `handleWasmCall` function receives event data from the WASM execution environment whenever an call matches the filters that was specified previously in the `project.ts`. It instantiates a new `Approval` entity and populates the fields with data from the Wasm Call payload. Then the `.save()` function is used to save the new entity (_SubQuery will automatically save this to the database_).

```ts
export async function handleBondAndStake(event: SubstrateEvent): Promise<void> {
  logger.info(
    `Processing new Dapp Staking Bond and Stake event at ${event.block.block.header.number}`,
  );
  const {
    event: {
      data: [accountId, smartContract, balanceOf],
    },
  } = event;
  // Retrieve the dapp by its ID
  let dapp: DApp = await DApp.get(smartContract.toString());
  if (!dapp) {
    dapp = DApp.create({
      id: smartContract.toString(),
      accountID: accountId.toString(),
      totalStake: BigInt(0),
    });
  }

  dapp.totalStake += (balanceOf as Balance).toBigInt();
  await dapp.save();
}
```

The `handleBondAndStake` function receives Substrate event data from the native Substrate environment whenever an event matches the filters that was specified previously in the `project.ts`. It extracts the various data from the event payload (in Substrate it's stored as an array of Codecs), then checks if an existing DApp record exists. If none exists (e.g. it's a new dApp), then it instantiates a new one and then updates the total stake to reflect the new staking mount. Then the `.save()` function is used to save the new/updated entity (_SubQuery will automatically save this to the database_).

Check out our mappings documentation for [Substrate](../../build/mapping/polkadot.md) and the [Substrate WASM data processor](../../build/substrate-wasm.md) to get detailed information on mapping functions for each type.
