The biggest dApps depend on SubQuery's enterprise level Managed Service. With 100s of millions of daily requests and hundreds of active projects, SubQuery's Managed Service provides industry leading hosting for our customers.",

In fact, <router-link :to='{path: \"/build/graph-migration.html\"}'>migrating from the Graph takes only a few hours</router-link>. Like The Graph, there are endless possibilities for the variety of data sources that can be analysed and served using SubQuery.",

      "<ul><li>Faster than others. Weâ€™re focusing on making SubQuery faster than other solutions with advanced indexing caches and precomputed indices saving developers time, our solution is fast to set-up, fast to manage and fast to index.</li><li>More Flexible and Feature rich. SubQuery is a scaffold for building custom APIs and we provide additional features like GraphQL subscriptions, multi-chain indexing, automated historical tracking and more.</li><li>Open. Customers have already extended our open source SDK to suit their own custom implementation.</li><li>Universal. A universal infrastructure stack bringing communities together, developers now have a tool to search, sort, filter and query any data for their app across multiple blockchains.</li></ul>",
      "Additionally, we are committed to running our Managed hosting service over the long term. We have made huge investments into it and have many customers relying on it. This provides a safe home and a reliable alternative to customers that are currently threatened by the imminent sunsetting of The Graph's hosted service.",
