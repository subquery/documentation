# The SubQuery Token (SQT)

The SubQuery Network is powered by the SubQuery Token (SQT). This token is the incentive mechanism driving the network, however, the network was not initially designed with a token in mind. The network was designed to provide value where Indexers would query, aggregate and then index blockchain data and make this available with speed and simplicity to Consumers who need blockchain data to power their applications. The SubQuery Token was a very natural solution allowing market participants to transact and transfer value. This approach ensured that the fundamental value of SubQuery drives the value of the token and not the other way around. 

Many pundits question the need for a token in any blockchain based projects. We have outlined a thesis on why SubQuery needs a token here.

## Tokenomics

### Supply

The initial supply will be 10 Billion tokens.

### Inflation

The inflation will be 2% per annum. This will be used to help the SubQuery Foundation bootstrap the network by supporting Indexers during the early launch phase where Consumers numbers will still be growing. 

### Allocation

Token allocation is as follows:

For more information, please refer to our whitepaper. 

### Vesting schedule

We have designed our vesting schedule to demonstrate the commitment of various stakeholders. The core team and the foundation has the longest vesting schedule of four and five years respectively. This will ensure that we have the resources and commitment to continue to build, grow and transition the network to a decentralised model. For further details, please refer to our whitepaper.
