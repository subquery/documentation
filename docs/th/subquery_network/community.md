# SubQuery Network Community

The key focus of the [SubQuery Foundation](./governance/foundation.md) and community is to ensure that there is enough support that anyone, from an expert blockchain team to a new hobbyist developer, can build their own Project. Together we can pave the way to a more decentralised future!

## Connecting with others

Discord is our main community for talking about SubQuery and learning more. You can join with [this link here](https://discord.com/invite/subquery). People most interested in the SubQuery Network will want to join `#network-general`, and Indexers or Delegators should join `#network-indexer-chat` or `#network-delegator-chat` respectively.

When the conversation is deeper and requires more thought, we move the conversation to [our Forum](https://forum.subquery.network/). Here you will find longer topics, a history of all announcements to Network, and deeper conversation about the direction of the network. Feel free to join and start posting at [forum.subquery.network](https://forum.subquery.network/)!

### Join the Node Operator community

If you're a Node Operator on the Network, we strongly suggest that you keep up with the latest news, announcements, and tips by joining the following Discord channels:

### SQTScan

[SQTScan](https://sqtscan.com/?ref=blog.subquery.network) is a ***community-owned application*** designed specifically to help expert users such as Node Operators and Delegators to gain a deeper understanding of historical rewards on the SubQuery Network and optimise their participation.

SQT Scan helps expert users (Node Operators and Delegators) with:

1. **Education:** Understand how their rewards are calculated and how they should make decisions
2. **Compare Opportunities:** Decide which projects to deploy based on historical rewards
3. **Compare Others:** Compare their APY with other Node Operators, overall and by project, to see how they're performing relatively
4. **APY Maximisation:** Identify ways to increase their APY

If you would like to add your support, suggest improvements or new features, or even contribute code, it is welcomed!

### Kepler Network Dashboard (by DappLooker)

To monitor the progress and performance of the Kepler Network, DappLooker has created a dashboard that displays the following key metrics:

- Active Indexers / Delegators: The number of Indexers and Delegators who are actively participating in the Kepler Network.
- Weekly Indexer Stake / Delegation: The amount of kSQT that Indexers and Delegators have staked on the Kepler Network in the past week.
- Weekly Rewards: The amount of kSQT that Indexers have earned as rewards for serving data requests on the Kepler Network in the past week.
- Stake Distribution: The distribution of kSQT stakes between Indexers and Delegators on the Kepler Network.

To make the data more accessible and user-friendly, DappLooker has also made the SubQuery Kepler data publicly available for everyone. This means that anyone can create custom dashboards tailored to their needs using the indexed data from the Kepler Network.
