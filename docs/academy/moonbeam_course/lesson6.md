# Lesson 6: Advanced Ideas

**This is the last lesson. Congratulations!**

So far we have managed to create a SubQuery project that indexes both Moonbeam and Substrate data and also altered it by exploring data mutation and data relationships examples.

This final lesson covers:

- Qick recap of previous lessons.
- Some of the advanced SubQuery features and optimization tips.
- Sharing multiple useful resources for further development.
