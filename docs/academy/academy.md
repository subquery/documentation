The SubQuery Academy helps developers to upskill in the SubQuery ecosystem by providing them with a modular programme. The content of this programme will take an aspiring blockchain developer from beginning to advanced level. Each course is 100% free and accessible online.

**SubQuery offers the following courses with more coming soon**

## The SubQuery Hero Course (Polkadot)

The course is designed in a way that even if you are a beginner and know very little about SubQuery, you will become an expert in building a SubQuery data source for your new Polkadot blockchain application. And that even includes developing complex SubQuery Projects and deploying them in SubQuery Projects.

Each module consists of 5-10 minutes video lessons. Each video is explained by industry experts and will guide you step by step. Moreover, to make it easier for you, each video content is followed by written tutorials, slides, lab workbooks, and links to the finished GitHub code repository. It focuses on the mantra of "learning by doing".

## The SubQuery Moonbeam Course (Moonbeam)

This course is focused on the Moonbeam and SubQuery integration and is crafted specifically for Moonbeam developers who are looking to index EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) data alognside Substrate data. It is a result of SubQuery's latest collaboration with Moonbeam to release a new course for web3 developers, who want to learn how to build a decentralised application on Moonbeam with the help of SubQuery. SubQuery was proud to be the first project to launch a course under Moonbeam’s very own Moonbuilders Academy. We are happy to feature this content here a part of SubQuery Academy.
