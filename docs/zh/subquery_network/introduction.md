# 简介

**SubQuery 网络是 Web3 基础设施的未来**

We’re building the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way. After publishing your project to the SubQuery Network, anyone can index and host it - providing data to users around the world faster and reliably.

The SubQuery Network is facilitating an open web3 data revolution by allowing you to completely decentralise your infrastructure stack.

网络中的每个人都有一个角色，从高技术开发人员到非高技术开发人员。 SubQuery 网络中包括四个主要参与者.

**Consumers** will ask the SubQuery Network for specific data for their dApps or tools, and pay an advertised amount of SQT for each request. Learn more about [Consumers](./consumers/introduction.md).

**RPC Providers (a Node Operator)** run the optimised SubQuery Data Node and are rewarded in SQT for providing reliable, scalable, and affordable RPC services to the network. Learn more about [RPC Providers](./node_operators/rpc_providers/introduction.md)

**Data Indexers (a Node Operator)** will run and maintain high quality SubQuery projects in their own infrastructure, running both the indexer and query service, and will be rewarded in SQT for the requests that they serve. Learn more about [Data Indexers](./node_operators/indexers/introduction.md).

**Delegators** will participate in the Network by supporting their favourite Node Operators to earn rewards based on the work those Node Operators do. Learn more about [Delegators](./delegators/introduction.md).

## SubQuery Kepler Network

SubQuery’s mission is to help developers create the decentralised products of the future. In order to realise this, we are focused on the release of the [decentralised SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/network). The final phase before launching the SubQuery Network is deploying the Kepler Network.

### Why Are We Launching Kepler?

You can think of Kepler as a pre-mainnet, a controlled phase that will help us bootstrap the mainnet with participants and activity.

In order to launch our decentralised network (The SubQuery Network), there are several technical milestones that must be met. The first significant milestone was achieved in 2022, with three successful ‘seasons’ (or phases) of our Frontier testnet which stress-tested the network in a test environment. After taking these learnings, we elected to take a novel approach by allowing participants in our testnet to get started on real world projects now via Kepler rather than waiting for the launching of our token.

A further consideration is that when we survey the web3 ecosystem today, we see that many other projects that provide decentralised services have made poor progress migrating customers from their centralised services to their decentralised alternatives. Kepler is designed to migrate real projects from our managed service to the decentralised SubQuery Kepler Network in a carefully choreographed way whilst providing incentives to all.

The rationale is that we can demonstrate both the technical and commercial applications of the SubQuery Network and bootstrap the mainnet with participants and activity to accelerate our growth.
