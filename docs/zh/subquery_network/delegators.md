# 代理

## 什么是代理？

代理是SubQuery网络中的非技术性网络角色，是开始参与SubQuery网络的一个好办法。 这种角色使代理们能够将他们的 SQT “委托”给一个或多个索引员，并获得奖励(类似于正在进行的)。

如果没有代理，索引员可能会获得较少的奖励，因为他们可以得到较少的 SQT 拨款。 因此，索引者通过竞争性地分享索引员的奖励来吸引代表。

## 担任代理的要求

关于担任代理的最好事情之一是你不需要任何委托、编码或技术经验。 成为代理所需要的只是对 SubQuery Network 的基本了解。

## 担任代理的好处

担任代理有若干好处：

- **Easy to get started**: Requiring little technical knowledge, Delegators only need to acquire SQT tokens and then learn the process of delegating the tokens to their preferred Indexer(s).
- **Contribute to the network**: Delegating to Indexers is a way to support an Indexer’s work service requests to consumers. In return, Delegators are rewarded with SQT.
- **Earn rewards**: Delegators can put their SQT to work by delegating their SQT to Indexers and earning a share of the reward pool.
- **No minimum delegation amount**: There is no minimum required delegation to be a Delegator. This means that anyone can join no matter how much SQT one has.

## How Delegators are rewarded?

To attract Delegators to support their work, Indexers offer Delegators a share of the rewards they earn. The Indexer will advertise an Indexer Commission Rate, where the remaining revenue will then be shared within the total delegation/staking pool proportionally to the individual delegated/staked value in the pool.

*Indexer’s Commission Rate*: This is a percentage share of the fees earned from serving requests to Consumers. Indexers are free to set this rate to any value they desire. A higher percentage indicates that Indexers keep more of the profits. A lower percentage indicates that the Indexers share more of their profits with their Delegators.

Delegators will only receive revenue for staking Eras that they were a part of for the entire period. For example, if they join a staking Era in the middle of the relevant period, then they will not earn any Query Fee revenue for that particular Era.

If an Indexer wishes to increase the Indexer Commission Rate that they offer to their Delegators, they must advertise this for an entire staking Era . The Indexer will be able to decrease their Indexer Commission Rate at any point to raise more delegated SQT for staking in the short term. Delegators can withdraw or undelegate their staked amount at any time, but they will forfeit any rewards earned within the staking Era (as they were not part of the delegation pool for the entire duration of the staking Era).

## Risks of being a Delegator

Even though it is not considered a risky role, being a Delegator includes a few risks to be aware of.

1. Market volatility risk: The constant fluctuations in the market is a risk that affects not just SQT, but all tokens in the general cryptocurrency marketplace. Taking a long term approach can reduce this type of risk.
2. Constant adjustments of staking parameters by Indexers and delegation fees can increase the risk to a Delegator. For example, a Delegator might miss a change in staking parameters resulting in a less than expected return. To reduce this risk, when Indexers decrease their stake parameters, it will only take effect after the next full Era has been completed, giving time for delegators to assess and make any changes.
3. Indexer poor performance: It is possible that Delegators can select Indexers that perform poorly and therefore provide a substandard return on investment to Delegators. Delegators are therefore encouraged to do Indexer due diligence on potential Indexers. A Reputation Index is also available to help Delegators compare Indexers to each other.

## How to select Indexers?

Delegators can select potential Indexers based on a *Reputation Index* or RI. This RI takes into account an Indexer’s uptime, indexer commission rate, slashing events, and Indexer parameter change frequency.

SubQuery will launch the official RI soon, but we expect other delegation applications to calculate and release their own.

## Non-reward period

Besides the period when Delegators can effectively earn money, a non-reward period also occurs. Delegators receive rewards for staking Eras that they were a part of for the entire duration. For example, if a Delegator joins a staking era halfway through, they will not earn any rewards for that particular era.

Delegators can change the indexer that their SQT is delegated to (called redelegating), this change will be queued to happen automatically at the end of the the Era and no thawing period will occur.

If a Delegator decides to undelegate their SQT, a 28 day thawing period starts. The tokens cannot be used during this period, no fees can be accrued or any reward gained.

## Indexer due diligence for Delegators

Once a preferred Indexer(s) is found, due diligence should be performed to check an Indexer’s reputation and reliability. Assessments could be performed to evaluate if the Indexer is active in the community, if the Indexer helps other members, if it is possible to get in touch with the Indexer, and if the Indexer is up-to-date with protocol and project updates.

## Delegation Lifecycle

Delegators delegate (deposit) SQT into an Indexer’s contract.

Delegators can then decide how much to redelegate to each Indexer of their choice.

Delegator can undelegate (withdraw) tokens back to their wallet. This will trigger a lock period of 28 days.

After the unlocking period has been completed, tokens become available for withdrawal/claim.
