# Current Network Parameters

The SubQuery technical council is constantly adjusting various parameters of the SubQuery Network to optimise for APR and sustainability, while ensuring prices are competitive compared to centralised alternatives. This page lists all the current network parameters and is kept up to date.

| Parameter                        | Value                | Descrizione                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Minimum Node Operator Stake      | 200,000 SQT          | All Node Operators must stake a minimum amount of SQT to become a Node Operator. See [Node Operator Stake](./node_operators/stake.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Delegation Capacity              | 12x                  | There is a maximum allowed delegation amount based on the size of the Node Operator's own stake, this ensures the Node Operator has sufficient skin in the game. Increasing own stake can mean delegators are able to delegate more to you. 12x means that the total stake (delegation + own stake) can be up to 12x the Node Operators own stake. |
| Network Inflation Rate           | 1.2% | New tokens minted and allocated to [network inflation rewards](./introduction/reward-distribution.md#network-inflation-rewards), or distributed to the SubQuery treasury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Network Inflation Rewards Rate   | 1%                   | The majority of network inflation acts as [network inflation rewards](./introduction/reward-distribution.md#network-inflation-rewards), while the remainder (0.2%) goes to the SubQuery Treasury                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Staking/Delegation Unlock Period | 14 days              | How long SQT is locked when it is unstaked or undelegated. Note that you can skip this period if you instead redelegate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Staking/Delegation Unlock Fee    | 0.1% | The network fee to unstake or undelegate your SQT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Dispute Deposit                  | 10,000 SQT           | The minimum amount to open up a network dispute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Offer Cancellation Penalty Rate  | 10%                  | When a consumer cancels an unexpired purchase offer, this penalty is taken from the offer and sent to the SubQuery treasury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Minimum Deployment Booster       | 1,000 SQT            | The minimum boost amount that must be boosted against a project deployment in order for the project deployment to start receiving booster rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
