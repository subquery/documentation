# Architects

## What is an Architect?

An Architect is a SubQuery network participant who creates SubQuery indexing projects for Node Operator to index

or convert subgraphs to SubQuery projects.

## Requirements to become an Architect

As Architects will be creating SubQuery projects, a technical background is highly recommended. Creating SubQuery
projects involves reading technical documentation and writing code. Having said this, there are numerous resources and a
SubQuery academy course that takes a beginner developer through the journey of creating SubQuery projects very quickly.

Architects may be dApp developers, data analytics experts, or someone with a solid technical background willing to learn
some simple coding concepts. Architects may also be Node Operators and host a node and serve blockchain data to
Consumers and be rewarded.

## Benefits of being an Architect

- Utilise your existing technical knowledge to earn rewards.
- Contribute to the network by providing SubQuery projects that the market demands.

## How Architects are rewarded?

We have grants to reward architects, their contributions are decided by the actual usage of the projects they helped
migrating to the Network.

## Next steps

You can already become an architect today, all you need to do is learn how to build a SubQuery project. View
