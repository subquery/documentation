# Architects

## What is an Architect?

An Architect is a SubQuery network participant who creates SubQuery projects for Indexers to index.

## Requirements to become an Architect

As Architects will be creating SubQuery projects, a technical background is highly recommended. Creating SubQuery projects involves reading technical documentation and writing code. Having said this, there are numerous resources and a SubQuery academy course that takes a beginner developer through the journey of creating SubQuery projects very quickly.

Architects may be dApp developers, data analytics experts, or someone with a solid technical background willing to learn some simple coding concepts. Architects may also be Indexers and host a node and serve blockchain data to Consumers and be rewarded.

## Benefits of being an Architect

- Utilise your existing technical knowledge to earn rewards.
- Contribute to the network by providing SubQuery projects that the market demands.

## How Architects are rewarded?

Architects can sell their services for creating SubQuery projects. Here, Architects can determine what SubQuery projects the Consumer market demands and build projects specifically for these Consumers. Alternatively, Architects can also index their own projects, and thus also become an Indexer and gain rewards from serving query data to Consumers.
