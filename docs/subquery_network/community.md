# SubQuery Network Community

The key focus of the [SubQuery Foundation](./governance/foundation.md) and community is to ensure that there is enough support that anyone, from an expert blockchain team to a new hobbyist developer, can build their own Project. Together we can pave the way to a more decentralised future!

## Developer Guild

It is our long term goal that a collection of independent organisations and individuals contribute to the SubQuery SDK, as well as the SubQuery Network contracts and applications. We've already taken steps towards this by introducing our open [Developer Guild](https://github.com/orgs/subquery/projects/3?pane=info), which is a collection of paid tasks that any developer can start working on today for inclusion in our codebases.

In the Open Task column, pick a task that interests you and start completing it. Tasks are reviewed on a first come first serve basis. Once done, create a PR and one of our team members will review it. If it meets the criteria and bug free, we'll merge it and contact you to arrange payment. For any questions or clarifications, please feel visit the `#sdk-technical-support` channel in Discord.

## Connecting with others

Discord is our main community for talking about SubQuery and learning more. You can join with [this link here](https://discord.com/invite/subquery). People most interested in the SubQuery Network will want to join `#network-general`, and Indexers or Delegators should join `#network-indexer-chat` or `#network-delegator-chat` respectively.

When the conversation is deeper and requires more thought, we move the conversation to [our Forum](https://forum.subquery.network/). Here you will find longer topics, a history of all announcements to Network, and deeper conversation about the direction of the network. Feel free to join and start posting at [forum.subquery.network](https://forum.subquery.network/)!

### Kepler Network Dashboard (by DappLooker)

To monitor the progress and performance of the Kepler Network, DappLooker has created a dashboard that displays the following key metrics:

- Active Indexers / Delegators: The number of Indexers and Delegators who are actively participating in the Kepler Network.
- Weekly Indexer Stake / Delegation: The amount of kSQT that Indexers and Delegators have staked on the Kepler Network in the past week.
- Weekly Rewards: The amount of kSQT that Indexers have earned as rewards for serving data requests on the Kepler Network in the past week.
- Stake Distribution: The distribution of kSQT stakes between Indexers and Delegators on the Kepler Network.

To make the data more accessible and user-friendly, DappLooker has also made the SubQuery Kepler data publicly available for everyone. This means that anyone can create custom dashboards tailored to their needs using the indexed data from the Kepler Network.
