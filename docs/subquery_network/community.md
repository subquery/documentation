# SubQuery Network Community

The key focus of the [SubQuery Foundation](./foundation.md) and community is to ensure that there is enough support that anyone, from an expert blockchain team to a new hobbyist developer, can build their own Project. Together we can pave the way to a more decentralised future!

## Connecting with others

Discord is our main community for talking about SubQuery and learning more. You can join with [this link here](https://discord.com/invite/subquery). People most interested in the SubQuery Kepler Network will want to join `#kepler-general`, and Indexers or Delegators should join `#kepler-indexer-chat` or `#kepler-delegator-chat` respectively.

## Post on our Forum

When the conversation is deeper and requires more thought, we move the conversation to [our Forum](https://forum.subquery.network/). Here you will find longer topics, a history of all announcements to Kepler, and deeper conversation about the direction of the network. Feel free to join and start posting at [forum.subquery.network](https://forum.subquery.network/)!

SubQuery is open source and open to the community, if you want to contribute (e.g. add a feature, fix a bug, suggest an improvement, or even just fix a typo in our documentation), please review our [contributing guide](../miscellaneous/contributing.md).
