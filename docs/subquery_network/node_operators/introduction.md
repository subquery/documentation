## Node Operators

SubQuery has a commitment to expanding the SubQuery Network to decentralise both Data Indexers, as well as supercharging RPCs to address a much broader centralisation issue throughout Web3 infrastructure. The SubQuery network will see thousands of decentralised Indexers and RPC providers (together called Node Operators) simplify the data layer for a myriad of applications and use cases.
