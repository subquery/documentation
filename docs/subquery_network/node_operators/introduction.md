## Node Operators / Indexers

:::info SubQuey Kepler Network

The SubQuery Kepler network only has the concept of Data Indexers. RPC Providers will launch with the mainnet.

:::

SubQuery has a commitment to expanding the SubQuery Network to decentralise both Data Indexers, as well as supercharging RPCs to address a much broader centralisation issue throughout Web3 infrastructure. The SubQuery network will see thousands of decentralised Indexers and RPC providers (together called Node Operators) simplify the data layer for a myriad of applications and use cases.
