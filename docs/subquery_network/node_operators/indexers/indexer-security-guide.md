# Indexer Security Guide

Indexers serve as the backbone of the SubQuery Network. They undertake the arduous task of running intensive indexing jobs and offer query services to the public.

Ensuring the security of Indexers is paramount, not only in the traditional infrastructure domain but also in the realm of web3.

## Potential Risks for Indexers

- Loss of funds from the controller wallet.
- Unauthorised activities of Indexers on the SubQuery Network executed via the controller wallet.
- Phishing schemes targeting the Indexer admin console, posing threats to the primary indexer wallet.
- System compromise, resulting in the Indexer's machine being hijacked by malicious actors.
- Risk of data corruption, physical hardware damage, and ransomware attacks.

## Architecture & Attack Vectors

The diagram below illustrates a suggested network topology of the Indexer's infrastructure. It's crucial to understand the architecture to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

![Suggested Topology](/assets/img/network/indexer_topology.png)

### Ports and Interfaces

**443 / 80**: For nginx â†’ indexer-proxy for HTTPS/HTTP indexers. If nginx is used, consult the [official docs for security controls](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/)

**8000**: This port is designated for administrative purposes only and MUST NOT be exposed to the public. This port should be configured to only allow access from your own IP address or via your secured VPN as it is used by indexer_coordinator. Establish Firewall rules to safeguard this port:

- If operating on public clouds, refer to the respective security group settings in their documentation.
- If running on bare metal and directly exposed to the internet, consider using tools like `ufw`/`ufw-docker`.
- If running from home, use router's settings and only open 433/80 via port forwarding.

::: details Setting up ufw-docker

Download `ufw-docker`` script:

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker
```

Then using the following command to modify the ` after.rules`` file of  `ufw``

```bash
ufw-docker install
```

Expose the port 7370:

```bash
ufw route allow proto udp from any to 172.18.0.10 port 7370 comment 'allow indexer_proxy 7370/udp indexer_services'
```

Expose the port 8000 allow Only My IP (change 192.168.10.1 to your IP Address):

```bash
ufw route allow proto tcp from 192.168.10.1 to 172.18.0.28 port 8000 comment 'allow indexer_coordinator 8000/tcp indexer_services'
```
:::tip Tip

You can find IPAddress Mapping ex `172.18.0.10`, `172.18.0.28` with 
```
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <container_id_or_name>
```

:::

Show the current firewall allowed forward rules

```bash
ufw-docker status
```

:::

**7370**: This port is generally safe to allow outbound and inbound traffic for Indexers proxy p2p network

### Docker

The Coordinator has unrestricted access to your host's Docker, which can pose security risks if not adequately shielded. If the machine is solely utilized for running SubQuery services, Indexers should contemplate applying specific Docker security measures. Refer to documentation on SeLinux or AppArmor for further insights.

### Other Best Practices

- Regularly update the host OS.
- Ensure the SubQuery service softwares are upgraded to the latest versions.

## SSL Certificate Configuration

SSL certificate is an important way to secure your indexer service and encrypt traffic between your query service and the Consumers requesting data from it. It's a good idea to obtain an SSL certificate for any professional service and SubQuery is no different. Additionally, a SSL certificate is required for when a Consumer access a website via SSL and that website is requesting data from your SubQuery project.

**Since it's such a standard best practice, although it's not required, we rank Indexers higher in the Indexer leaderboard if they have SSL enabled. You can tell if an Indexer has SSL enabled by confirming that the `Proxy Server Endpoint` in indexer's metadata starts with `https` instead of `http`.**

### Enabling SSL

**1. Purchase a domain name**: You can purchase a domain from a lot of domain providers, we won't be providing a guide on how to do this. The rest of this guide assumes you have purchased `mysqindexer.com`

**2. Config DNS**: Add a A record to your domain that points to your indexer's server IP address. For example, we add an A record for `proxy.mysqindexer.com` to our server's IP `210.10.5.61`.

**3. Get a SSL Cert**: You can get a free SSL Cert from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), they offer a lot of ways to get a SSL Cert, you can choose the [one that fits your needs](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/). This tutorial will use Certbot + NGINX + Ubuntu as an example.

3.1. Install Certbot: Check [https://certbot.eff.org/instructions](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) on how to do this step
3.2. Install Nginx: We will use nginx for two purpose.

1.  Listen on port 80 to allow Let's encrypt to verify your domain name.
2.  As a reverse proxy to forward traffic from port 443 (https) to indexer-proxy.

```shell
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

3.3. Reconfig indexer-proxy: In the default settings, indexer-proxy listen on port 80, now we need to change it to 1080.

```shell
# docker-compose.yml
proxy:
    image: subquerynetwork/indexer-proxy:v1.3.9
    container_name: indexer_proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 1080:1080
    command:
      - --host=0.0.0.0
      - --port=1080
      - --auth
      - --jwt-secret=<...>
      - --secret-key=<...>
      - --service-url=http://indexer_coordinator:8000
      - --network=kepler                                  # network type, need to be same with coordinator
      - --network-endpoint=https://polygon-rpc.com
      - --token-duration=24                                 # query auth token validity [hours]
      - --redis-endpoint=redis://indexer_cache
```

then restart the indexer-proxy container

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

3.4. Config NGINX: Edit your NGINX configuration to add the following (e.g. it would usually be at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy.mysqindexer.com`)

```shell
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy.mysqindexer.com
server {
    listen 443 ssl; // Update the ports to listen on
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    server_name proxy.mysqindexer.com; // update the server name to match your DNS address

    location / {
      proxy_pass      http://127.0.0.1:1080;
    }

}

# link the new configution with a symlink to your edited file
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy.mysqindexer.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/proxy.mysqindexer.com
```

**4 Run certbot**

```bash
# run certbot
sudo certbot --nginx -d proxy.mysqindexer.com

# output

# Requesting a certificate for proxy.mysqindexer.com

# This certificate expires on 2023-08-06.
# These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
# Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.
