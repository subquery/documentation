# Tokenomics

:::warning
Please note that everything below is still subject to change.
:::

Total Supply: The total supply will be 10 Billion SQT tokens.

Inflation: The inflation is expected to be ~2% per annum. This will be used to help the SubQuery Foundation bootstrap the network by supporting Indexers during the early launch phase where Consumers numbers will still be growing.

From the start, SubQuery has been focused on building value within the community and this aim continues with the largest allocation of tokens (~51%) being apportioned to the Community, SubQuery Foundation, and for the public sale.

The Foundation, which is expected to be established in late 2023, will administer the future governance and growth of the ecosystem and the ownership of the SubQuery Network will come under the SubQuery Foundation initially. This large allocation also includes consideration for future investment into the development and operations of the Network, and key ecosystem growth drivers. This will include tools such as grants and ecosystem incentives/events as well as other marketing activities including bug bounties and mainnet incentives.

Early investors in both the Seed, Series A, and Series B rounds have a combined allocation of ~29%. In the case of our seed investors, SubQuery is grateful for their early vision and commitment to build the initial phase of SubQuery. Following on from this, growth was accelerated with the support of Series A and B investors who allowed the project to accelerate to the next level.cce

Finally, the SubQuery Team and Launch Partners have been allocated 20% of the token supply in return for their tireless dedication and contribution in building and promoting the project over multiple years of hard work.

## Vesting schedule

We have designed our vesting schedule to demonstrate the commitment of various stakeholders. The graphic below illustrates the planned release of the SQT tokens to each participant over time culminating in the full circulation of tokens occurring 5 years (60 months) after launch.

The vesting schedules for each participant has been designed to create long-term value for the project and generate confidence to token-holders. Perhaps most significantly, the core team will have a 24 month lock-up period which will then vest over another 24 months while some Public Sale participants can freely use the utility of their token upon launch.

The Foundation and Community will have approximately 30% of the allocation unlocked from the start to meet the operational needs of launching and promoting mainnet with the rest of the allocation vesting gradually over 5 years.
