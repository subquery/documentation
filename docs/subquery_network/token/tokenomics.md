# Tokenomics

:::warning
Please note that detailed tokenomics will be [released closer to the token sale](https://subquery.foundation/sale)
:::

Total Supply: The total supply will be 10 Billion SQT tokens.

Inflation: The inflation is expected to be ~2% per annum. This will be used to help the SubQuery Foundation bootstrap the network by supporting Node Operators during the early launch phase where Consumers numbers will still be growing.

From the start, SubQuery has been focused on building value within the community and this aim continues with the largest allocation of tokens on launch being apportioned to the Community, SubQuery Foundation, and for the public sale.

The [SubQuery Foundation](https://subquery.foundation), will administer the future governance and growth of the ecosystem and the ownership of the SubQuery Network will come under the SubQuery Foundation initially. This large allocation also includes consideration for future investment into the development and operations of the Network, and key ecosystem growth drivers. This will include tools such as grants and ecosystem incentives/events as well as other marketing activities including bug bounties and mainnet incentives.

## Vesting schedule

We have designed our vesting schedule to demonstrate the commitment of various stakeholders. The planned release of SQT tokens after launch will take time culminating in the full circulation of tokens at least 4 years (48 months) after launch.

The vesting schedules for each participant has been designed to create long-term value for the project and generate confidence to token-holders. Perhaps most significantly, the core team will have a vesting period of 48 months while some Public Sale participants can freely use the utility of their token upon launch.

The Foundation and Community will have portion of their allocation unlocked from the start to meet the operational needs of launching and promoting mainnet with the rest of the allocation vesting gradually over subsequent years.
