# Tokenomics 2.0 Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines an immediate shift from inflationary to sustainable tokenomics, transitioning from network inflation rewards to a revenue-backed model while enhancing community ownership of the network.

## Current State Analysis

**Current Metrics:**
- **Network Inflation Rate**: 1% annually (with compound effect)
- **Annual Inflation**: 100M SQT tokens (at 10B total supply initially)
- **Key Insight**: Significant portion of inflation remains undistributed and creates unnecessary token dilution

## Tokenomics 2.0 Framework

### 1. Immediate Non-Inflationary Model

**Key Changes (Effective Immediately After Snapshot Vote):**
- **Network Inflation**: Reduced to 0% (no new token minting)
- **Total Supply**: Fixed at 10.19 Billion SQT
- **Reward Sources**:
  - Foundation Treasury distributions

### 2. Revenue-Backed Reward System

**Query Fee Revenue Share:**
- **Percentage of query fees** distributed directly to Node Operators as rewards
- **Portion to Foundation Treasury** as supplementary

**Foundation Treasury Structure:**

Reduced Foundation Role: Enhanced Community Ownership
- Foundation allocation reduced to enhance decentralization
- Community ownership increased significantly
- More tokens distributed to active network participants


### 3. Sustainability Mechanisms

#### A) Protocol Fee Structure (Existing Revenue Sources)

**Unstaking Fees:**

**Service Agreement Fees:**

#### B) Premium Services (Additional Revenue)

**SubQuery AI products:**
- Service payment

**Enterprise Tiers:**
- Priority indexing
- Performance guarantees
- Dedicated support

**Developer Tools:**
- Advanced monitoring
- Premium debugging

### 5. Community Ownership Benefits

**Enhanced Decentralization:**
- **Foundation ownership reduced**
- **Community ownership increased**
- **True decentralization**: Network rewards tied to actual usage, not token printing
- **Sustainable economics**: Rewards scale with network adoption

**Governance Implications:**
- More token distribution to active participants
- Reduced central control over token supply
- Community-driven network growth

## Implementation Strategy

**Immediate Implementation (Post Snapshot Vote):**
1. **Smart Contract Updates**: Disable inflation mechanism
2. **Treasury Management**: Foundation will take over and fund the current treasury wallet
3. **Communication**: Clear messaging about benefits to Node Operators

**Operator Impact Analysis:**
- **No reduction in rewards** (maintained at current levels)
- **Long-term stability**: Rewards tied to network usage growth
- **Reduced dilution**: No more inflationary pressure on token value

## Risk Analysis

**New Considerations:**
- **Price Volatility**: Rewards in SQT, revenue may come in other tokens

## Community Benefits Summary

1. **Enhanced Ownership**: Increased community ownership percentage
2. **Sustainable Rewards**: Based on actual network usage
3. **Reduced Inflation**: No more token printing
4. **True Decentralization**: Less Foundation control
5. **Value Accrual**: Token value tied to network success

This model creates a truly sustainable, community-owned network where rewards are generated from actual usage rather than artificial inflation.
