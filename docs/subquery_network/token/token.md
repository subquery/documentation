# The SubQuery Token (SQT)

The SubQuery Network is powered by the SubQuery Token (SQT).

The SubQuery Token (SQT) is designed as a utility token that powers the SubQuery Network, providing an incentive for participation, as well as serving as a medium of exchange for transactions within the SubQuery Network. Consumers of data will commit SQT in exchange for RPC queries from RPC Providers or indexed data from Data Indexers and this SQT will be distributed among Node Operators based on the payment method selected.

The network is designed to provide value where Node Operators can index, aggregate and then serve blockchain data and make this available with speed and simplicity to Consumers who need blockchain data to power their applications. SQT is a natural solution allowing market participants to transact and transfer value. This approach ensures that the fundamental value of SubQuery drives the value of the token and not the other way around.

There is no intention for SQT to be used as a medium of exchange for goods or services outside of the SubQuery Network. SQT does not in any way represent or confer upon its holders any right to, title of, interest or participation in, the ownership, shareholding and/or management of SubQuery whatsoever. SQT will not entitle holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits, or investment returns.
