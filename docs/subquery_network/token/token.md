# The SubQuery Tokens (SQT and kSQT)

The SubQuery Network is powered by the SubQuery Token (SQT). Kepler has it's own token for the Kepler network with its own supply and contract address, please read more about it there under [kSQT](#ksqt).

The SubQuery Token (SQT) is designed as a utility token that powers the SubQuery Network, providing an incentive for participation, as well as serving as a medium of exchange for transactions within the SubQuery Network. Consumers of data will commit SQT in exchange for data from Indexers and this SQT will be distributed among Indexers based on the payment method selected.

The network is designed to provide value where Indexers can index, aggregate and then serve blockchain data and make this available with speed and simplicity to Consumers who need blockchain data to power their applications. SQT is a natural solution allowing market participants to transact and transfer value. This approach ensures that the fundamental value of SubQuery drives the value of the token and not the other way around.

There is no intention for SQT to be used as a medium of exchange for goods or services outside of the SubQuery Network. SQT does not in any way represent or confer upon its holders any right to, title of, interest or participation in, the ownership, shareholding and/or management of SubQuery whatsoever. SQT will not entitle holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits, or investment returns.

## KSQT

kSQT is the name of the token that is used by participants who operate within the Kepler Network. This token mimics the properties of the eventual SubQuery Network token (SQT) in that tokens will be rewarded to Indexers for performing tasks and Delegators can allocate their tokens to indexers to secure the network and receive rewards.

Kepler is designed to enable participants to provide value to real projects which are migrated from SubQueryâ€™s managed service to the decentralised offering and receive incentives via the Kepler token (kSQT). The kSQT token is issued with a very limited supply, but users can swap kSQT to USDC using our [Swap feature](./swap.md).

### Adding kSQT to your Wallet

kSQT is deployed on the Polygon network with the following contract address:

`0xcEE50Ee839a2ab3914cF4c3cbAc78f6F11E0c937` ([PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xcEE50Ee839a2ab3914cF4c3cbAc78f6F11E0c937)).

You can add it to your wallet from the wallet selector in the [Kepler App](https://kepler.subquery.network/explorer).

### How do I Receive kSQT?

The supply of kSQT is intentionally heavily restricted and has been airdropped to Indexers and Ambassadors to help launch the network and show our appreciation for their support. For users that did not receive an airdrop, kSQT can be swapped using our [Swap feature](./swap.md).

Upon the retirement of Kepler, all kSQT can be burnt in exchange for SQT after SubQuery Network launch.
