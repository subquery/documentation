# Claiming your SQT tokens?

## How to claim your SubQuery (SQT) tokens?

To claim your subquery tokens, visit [https://claim.subquery.foundation](https://claim.subquery.foundation). Please check the URL carefully. Another option is to head over to [https://www.subquery.foundation](https://www.subquery.foundation/) and click on the SQT Claim link in the top navigation bar. This will open up the SubQuery Token Claim page and ask for a wallet to be connected.

The first step token is to connect your crypto wallet. We recommend either Metamask, WalletConnect, Talisman or Rainbow.

You should have a wallet already before claiming your tokens. If you are claiming your public sale tokens, you need to use the same wallet address you used in the sale. If claiming NFTs or airdropped tokens, make sure you are using the correct wallet address that the SubQuery team has distributed your tokens to

Select the appropriate account and then click next. Approve the connection to the Base network, then switch to the Base mainnet from your current network if required.

The SubQuery Token Claim claim page should load up showing any token allocation that you have permission to claim. Note that the balance may show 0 prior to TGE. Once the tokens have been generated and allocated on the token generation date, the balance should reflect your correct amount.

Connect and log into your hardware wallet and it should appear on the list. If it doesn’t, refresh your screen and try again.

Immediately after claiming your tokens, you can put them to productive use on the SubQuery Network mainnet - for example by delegating to your favourite indexer or boosting your favourite project to earn rewards.

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong network

If you are connected to the wrong network, you will be asked to switch to the Base network.
