# Bridging Tokens to Base

Although SQT is an ERC20 token minted on Ethereum Mainnet, the SubQuery Network operates on the Base Network. You will need to bridge your tokens between these networks, thankfully this is quite straightforward.

SubQuery provides an official Bridge UI on our [official Network App](https://app.subquery.network/bridge) that supports bridging from Eth -> Base (and vice versa). This allows you to bridge any free SQT from Ethereum to Base and is built using the same contracts and messaging protocols as the official [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org/deposit).

## Other Bridges

The official bridge, [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org/deposit), does not yet support SubQuery and there are other [quicker third-party bridges](https://base.org/ecosystem?tag=bridge), for example [superbridge.app](https://superbridge.app/), SubQuery can't be responsible for the use of any third-party bridges.
