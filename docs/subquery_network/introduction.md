# Introduction

**The SubQuery Network is the future of web3 infrastructure**

We’re building the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way. After publishing your project to the SubQuery Network, anyone can index and host it - providing data to users around the world faster and reliably.

The SubQuery Network is facilitating an open web3 data revolution by allowing you to completely decentralise your infrastructure stack.

There’s a role for everyone in the network, from highly technical developers to those that are not. The SubQuery network includes four main network participants.

**Consumers** will ask the SubQuery Network for specific data for their dApps or tools, and pay an advertised amount of SQT for each request. Learn more about [Consumers](./consumers/introduction.md).

**Indexers** will run and maintain high quality SubQuery projects in their own infrastructure, running both the indexer and query service, and will be rewarded in SQT for the requests that they serve. Learn more about [Indexers](./indexers/introduction.md).

**Delegators** will participate in the Network by supporting their favourite Indexers to earn rewards based on the work those indexers do. Learn more about [Delegators](./delegators/introduction.md).

## SubQuery Kepler Network

SubQuery’s mission is to help developers create the decentralised products of the future. In order to realise this, we are focused on the release of the [decentralised SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/network). The final phase before launching the SubQuery Network is deploying the Kepler Network.

### Why Are We Launching Kepler?

You can think of Kepler as a pre-mainnet, a controlled phase that will help us bootstrap the mainnet with participants and activity.

In order to launch our decentralised network (The SubQuery Network), there are several technical milestones that must be met. The first significant milestone was achieved in 2022, with three successful ‘seasons’ (or phases) of our Frontier testnet which stress-tested the network in a test environment. After taking these learnings, we elected to take a novel approach by allowing participants in our testnet to get started on real world projects now via Kepler rather than waiting for the launching of our token.

A further consideration is that when we survey the web3 ecosystem today, we see that many other projects that provide decentralised services have made poor progress migrating customers from their centralised services to their decentralised alternatives. Kepler is designed to migrate real projects from our managed service to the decentralised SubQuery Kepler Network in a carefully choreographed way whilst providing incentives to all.

The rationale is that we can demonstrate both the technical and commercial applications of the SubQuery Network and bootstrap the mainnet with participants and activity to accelerate our growth.
