# Managing Plans

For the intial stages of Kepler, the SubQuery Council will set some default plan templates to make plan management and creation easier, and speed up the testing and analysis of various parameters of the network. As a result, plan creation is very easy and just requires to you enter a price.

All plans will be orientated around the length of an Era, which is currently one week but may be increased to a fortnight (two weeks). Towards the end of each era, we will release the suggested plan templates, recommended pricing, an and other instructons for the start of the next period.

**We strongly recommend not exceeding our recommended pricing when setting your price, otherwise you might not be picked for the next era**
