# Managing Plans and Agreements

For the initial stages of Kepler, the SubQuery Council will set some default plan templates to make plan management and creation easier, and speed up the testing and analysis of various parameters of the network. As a result, plan creation is very easy and just requires to you enter a price.

All plans will be orientated around the length of an Era, which is currently one week but may be increased to a fortnight (two weeks). Towards the end of each era, we will release the suggested plan templates, recommended pricing, an and other instructions for the start of the next period.

**We strongly recommend not exceeding our recommended pricing when setting your price, otherwise you might not be picked for the next era**

## Creating a Plan

To create a default plan, on the Indexer Admin App, navigate to `Plan & Offer` -> `My Plans`. Then select `Create a Plan`.

You will see a pop-up to confirm your transaction with Metamask. Click on `Confirm` and wait for a few seconds. Then you will see a default plan created in the `Default` tab.

:::info Kepler will automatically select your plan

Note, for the Kepler network, the SubQuery council will automatically select and create agreements from the best indexers based off your plans. You don't need to do anything else here to be selected apart from performing your key role as an indexer.

## Claiming Rewards from a Plan Agreement

Note, you need to wait for the Era completes before the rewards can be claimed. So if you receive rewards during Era 1, you can only claim them after Era 2 starts. This gives consumers sufficient time to lodge any disputes.

To claim your rewards, head to `Rewards` under your profile. Then click `Claim`.

Then confirm the transaction with MetaMask as asked.

Wait for a few seconds and you will see the status as `claimed` under the `Action` column.
