# kSQT

kSQT is the name of the token that is used by participants who operate within the Kepler Network. This token mimics the properties of the eventual SubQuery Network token (SQT) in that tokens will be rewarded to Indexers for performing tasks and Delegators can allocate their tokens to indexers to secure the network and receive rewards.

Kepler is designed to enable participants to provide value to real projects which are migrated from SubQuery’s managed service to the decentralised offering and receive incentives via the Kepler token (kSQT). The kSQT token will be issued with a very limited supply, but users can swap kSQT to USDC using our [Swap feature](./swap.md).

## How do I Receive kSQT?

The supply of kSQT will be heavily restricted and will be airdropped to Indexers and Ambassadors to help launch the network and show our appreciation for their support.

We have selected Kepler Airdrops in the following manner:

- The main recipients will be Indexers selected from the SubQuery Frontier testnet who participated and received sufficient points (Phase 1) - you can check if you are an eligible indexer on this [list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yscpQYMyaeqU6F10HC__-2o84YPrru75oDmwkcyFNa4/edit?usp=sharing).
- Ambassadors will receive tokens to act in the role of Delegators (Phase 2)

The tokens will be airdropped in two phases, with the first allocation to Indexers near Network launch. We will announce the dates for Phase 2 once we’re confident that indexers have onboarded correctly and the Kepler network is running well .

Upon the retirement of Kepler, all kSQT can be burnt in exchange for SQT after SubQuery Network launch.
