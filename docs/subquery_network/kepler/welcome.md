# Welcome

Welcome to Kepler, SubQuery's canary network. The Kepler network is the final stage before mainnet where network participants can be part of the SubQuery network and be rewarded with kSQT tokens which have real-world value.

Learn more about our network participants [here](../introduction.md), before jumping in and learning how to become an [Indexer](../kepler/indexers/become-an-indexer.md), [Delegator](../delegators.md), or a [Consumer](../consumers.md). First though, learn more about the Kepler dashboard below.

## Kepler Dashboard

The Kepler dashboard is divided into several sections as can be seen below.

### Explorer

The explorer displays a list of all the projects that are being indexed. Itâ€™s also the place where consumers can select a particular project and purchase the associated plans. If no plans are listed, this indicates that an Indexer has not yet created a plan.

### Studio

The studio allows developers to create, install, deploy and publish SubQuery projects.

### Stake & Delegate: 

This area:
- Allows Indexers and Delegators to manage their [stake](../terminology.md#staking), [delegation](../terminology.md#delegating), rewards, and view tokens that are [locked](../terminology.md#lock-period). 
- Allows Delegators to select Indexers and delegate their [SQT](../token.md).
- Allows Indexers to delegate to projects.

### Plans & Offers

This area:
- Lists [service agreements](../../glossary/glossary.md#service-agreements).
- Allows Indexers to create and manage their plans.
- Allows Consumers to create and manage their offers.
- Displays an offer marketplace where Indexers can accept an offer from Consumers.
