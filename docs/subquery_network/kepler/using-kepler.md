## Kepler Dashboard

The Kepler dashboard is divided into several sections as can be seen below.

### Explorer

The explorer displays a list of all the projects that are being indexed. Itâ€™s also the place where consumers can select a particular project and purchase the associated plans. If no plans are listed, this indicates that an Indexer has not yet created a plan.
