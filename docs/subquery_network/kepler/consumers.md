# Consumers

## Introduction 

This guide explains what a consumer is and includes the necessary steps to become one. It also gives you an insight the benefits of becoming a consumer. 

## Why Become a Consumer?

As a [consumer](../../consumers.md), you can get indexed data by entering into an agreement with an Indexer. In return, you can query the data you need quickly for your dApps, thereby saving you time figuring out how to get blockchain data yourself. 

**Begin your journey as a consumer by creating an offer. Follow any of these two methods:**

1. Create your own  offer
2. Purchase an Indexer's plan 

### Initial Preparation: 

Before you create or purchase your first offer on SubQuery's Frontier Testnet, you must connect with **MetaMask**. Follow [these guided steps](./metamask/connect-metamask.md) and connect with MetaMask.

## How to make a use of your purchased plan and indexed data?

### Playground 

Playground is the place where you can run the readily available query(from any of your purchased plans). You can directly run or test the code right there and retrieve the data. 


- Once you have purchased an offer using any of the above methods, head to `Plan & Offer`-> `My Service Agreements` tab.

- Under the `Ongoing` tab, you will see a list of service agreements for respective purchased plans. Select the playground of your preferred plan in the last column `Action`.
