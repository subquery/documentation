# The Era

The SubQuery Network is oriented around a single constant heartbeat or period - this is called the **Era**.

Currently the Era is 7 days (earth time). The Era represents a period that many settings and actions within the SubQuery Network are orientated around including:

- Network reward allocations are made at the end of an Era
- The length of Plans are represented in a number of Era
- Any re-staging or re-delegation actions will be queued up for the end of the Era
- Changes to the Node Operator Commission Rate (NOCR) will be queued up for the end of the Era (or the subsequent Era in some cases)
