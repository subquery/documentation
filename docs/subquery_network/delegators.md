# Delegators

## What is a Delegator?

A Delegator is a non-technical network role in the SubQuery network and is a great way to start contributing to the SubQuery network. This role enables Delegators to “delegate” their SQT to one or more Indexers. Delegators benefit by having their SQT earn a “commission reward” for their efforts. On the other hand, Indexers benefit by acquiring more SQT to stake towards their projects of interest, thereby increasing their earning potential. 

Without Delegators, Indexers will likely earn fewer rewards because they will have less SQT to allocate. Therefore, Indexers compete to attract Delegators by offering a competitive share of an Indexer’s rewards.

## Requirements to be a Delegator

One of the best things about being a Delegator is that you don’t need any powerful computer configuration and specific technical requirements. Any computer with a connection to the internet is all that is required to become a Delegator.

## Benefits of being a Delegator

There are several benefits of becoming a Delegator:

* Easy to get started - Requiring little technical knowledge, Delegators only need to acquire SQT tokens and then learn the process of delegating the tokens to their preferred Indexer(s). 
* Contribute to the network - Indexers serve blockchain data to their customers. Delegating to Indexers is a way to support an Indexer’s initiative. In return, Delegators are rewarded.
* To earn rewards - Delegators can put their SQT to work by delegating their SQT to Indexers and earning a share of the reward pool. 
* No minimum limit - There is no minimum limit to be a Delegator. This means that anyone can join no matter how many SQT one has. 

## How Delegators are rewarded?

To attract Delegators to support their activities, Indexers offer potential Delegators a share of the rewards they earn. The primary goal of an Indexer is to earn fees for the Indexing service they provide. Delegators help Indexers to effectively achieve these goals. With a purpose to attract Delegators, an Indexer advertises the portion of rewards that the Indexer will share with the Delegator. That portion is called the Indexer’s Commission Rate. 

Indexer’s Commission Rate: This is a percentage share of the fees earned from serving requests to Consumers. Indexers are free to set this rate to any value they desire. A higher percentage indicates that Indexers keep more of the profits. A lower percentage indicates that the Indexers share more of their profits with their Delegators.

## Risks of being a Delegator

Even though it is not considered a risky role, being a Delegator includes a few risks to be aware of. 

1. Market volatility risk:  The constant fluctuations in the market is a risk that affects not just SQT, but all tokens in the general cryptocurrency marketplace. Taking a long term approach can reduce this type of risk.  
2. Constant adjustments of staking parameters by Indexers and delegation fees can increase the risk to a Delegator. For example, a Delegator might miss a change in staking parameters resulting in a less than expected return. To reduce this risk, when Indexers decrease their stake parameters, it will only take effect after the next full Era has been completed. 
3. Indexer poor performance: It is possible that Delegators can select Indexers that perform poorly and therefore provide a substandard return on investment to Delegators. Delegators are therefore encouraged to do Indexer due diligence on potential Indexers. A Reputation Index is also available to help Delegators compare Indexers to each other. 

## How to select Indexers?

Delegators can select potential Indexers based on a “Reputation Index” or RI. This RI takes into account an Indexer’s uptime, ICR, slashing events, and Indexer parameter change frequency. 

## Non-reward period

Besides the period when Delegators can effectively earn money, a non-reward period also occurs. Delegators receive rewards for staking eras that they were a part of for the entire duration. For example, if a Delegator joins a staking era halfway through, they will not earn any rewards for that particular era. 

Additionally, if a Delegator decides to undelegate his/her SQT, a 28 day thawing period starts. The tokens cannot be moved during this period, no fees can be accrued or a reward acquired.

## Indexer due diligence for Delegators

Once a preferred Indexer(s) is found, due diligence should be performed to check an Indexer’s reputation and reliability. Assessments could be performed to evaluate if the Indexer is active in the community, if the Indexer helping other members, is it possible to get in touch with the Indexer, and if the Indexer is up-to-date with the protocol updates. 

## Steps for delegation

Delegators delegate (deposit) SQT into an Indexer’s contract. 
Delegators can then decide how much to redelegate to each Indexer of their choice. 
Delegator can undelegate (withdraw) tokens back to their wallet. This will trigger a lock period of 28 days. 
After the unlocking period has been completed, tokens become available for withdrawal/claim.
