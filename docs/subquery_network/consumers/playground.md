# Playground

The Playground is a place where you can run readily available queries (from any of your purchased plans). You can directly run or test the GraphQL queries right in the playground and retrieve the data for analysis on an ad-hoc basis.

Once you have purchased an offer using any of the above methods, head to `Plan & Offer`-> `My Service Agreements` tab.

Under the `Ongoing` tab, you will see a list of service agreements for respective purchased plans. Select the playground of your preferred plan in the last column `Action`.

You will be redirected to a page, known as the Playground.

You will then see a code that you can directly use as the query and get the chain data for your project. You can also modify this query as per your requirements and retrieve the data in the desired format.

::: tip Note
You can visit the expired plan's service agreement under the `Expired` tab.
