# How to suggest an RPC

Please [contact us](https://subquery.network/contact) providing the following details of the RPC you would like to add:
- RPC Name
- RPC Type (Archive or Full Node)
- Project Website

## Requirements

- To suggest an archive node, 4M SQT needs to be locked for a period of 6 months. 
- To suggest a full node, 2M SQT needs to be locked for a period of 6 months.
- The lock period will start when the RPC is live.
- When the RPC is live, these locked tokens will be used to boost the RPC to incentivise Node Operators to run them.
- Should no Node Operators run this RPC within three weeks of going live, the tokens will be unlocked.
