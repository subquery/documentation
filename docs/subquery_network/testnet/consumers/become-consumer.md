# How to Become a Consumer

## Introduction 

Welcome to the **step-by-step guide to becoming a Consumer.** This guide explains what is a consumer and includes the necessary steps to become one. 

It also gives you an insight into what benefits you can avail as a consumer. 

Before you begin exploring further, visit [Frontier](https://frontier.subquery.network/explorer) - SubQuery’s Testnet. This guide takes this testnet into account.  

## Why to Become a Consumer?

As a [consumer](../../consumers.md), you can get indexed data by determining a specific rate (in SQT). In return, you can test and query the data quickly for your dApps and save your time. 


**Begin your journey as a consumer by creating an offer. Follow any of these two methods:**

1. Create your own purchase offer
2. Purchase an Indexer's plan 

### Initial Preparation: 

Before you create or purchase your first offer on SubQuery's Frontier Testnet, you must connect with **MetaMask**. Follow [these guided steps](../metamask/connect-metamask.md) and connect with MetaMask. 

Now, let's move ahead. 

### Method-1. Create Your Own Offer

To create your own offer, follow the steps shown [here.](../season3-challenges/season3.md#_1-create-a-purchase-offer)

### Method-2. Purchase an Indexer's Plan 

To purchase an indexer’s plan, follow the steps shown [here.](../season3-challenges/season3.md#_5-purchase-a-plan-from-an-indexer)



## How to make a use of your purchased plan and indexed data?

### Playground 

Playground is the place where you can run the readily available query(from any of your purchased plans). You can directly run or test the code right there and retrieve the data. 


- Once you have purchased an offer using any of the above methods, head to `Plan & Offer`-> `My Service Agreements` tab.

- Under the `Ongoing` tab, you will see a list of service agreements for respective purchased plans. Select the playground of your preferred plan in the last column `Action`.

- You will be redirected to a page, generally known as the Playground. 

- You will then see a code that you can directly use as the query and get the chain data for your project. You can also modify this query as per your requirements and retrieve the data in the desired format.

You can visit the expired plan's service agreement under the `Expired` tab.
