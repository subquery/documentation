# How to Request Testnet Tokens?

There are two types of tokens on the Testnet:

- ACA tokens (the equivalent of ETH) for gas fee
- SQT tokens for staking (contract address is `0x6B3953381f777Fa7136f1EA263e37174440090D1`)

You can receive ACA and SQT tokens from the [faucet channel](https://discord.com/channels/796198414798028831/949038537053966446) under the Frontier Testnet Group in SubQueryâ€™s Discord community.

## ACA tokens

- Copy your account address from MetaMask and type `!drip <address>` to send SQT and ACA tokens to a given address. You can only make this call **once per 6 hour**.
- You will receive the tokens within a few minutes.
