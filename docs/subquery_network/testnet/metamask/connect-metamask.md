# How to Connect to MetaMask?

## Introduction

After starting the Indexing Service on your preferred hosting enviornment(Local, AWS, or Linux), the next step is to connect to MetaMask.

MetaMask is the browser-based crypto wallet that allows you to interact with the SubQuery Web3 application. If you do not have MetaMask, please download it from the appropriate “store” and install it.

## Steps to Connect to MetaMask

### 1. Initial Preparation:

Navigate to your Indexer administration page at: https://frontier.subquery.network/explorer. Then, you will see the following message:

### 2. Add a network

Once MetaMask is installed, the network can be automatically imported.

If there are issues with the auto import, manually add the network by selecting the network dropdown and click “Add Network”.
