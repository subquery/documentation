## Why to Become a Delegator?

As a delegator, you not only delegate SQT to Indexers, but you also validate and support Indexers to provide their service with better rewards. If needed, you can also undelegate from an indexer and thus, you help the network to become more transparent and secure. In return, you get your share of rewards (in SQT) from the reward pool.

As a delegator, you can perform the following tasks: 

1. Delegate and undelegate your SQT
2. Claim and withdraw rewards

Let's have a look at the process of delegating and undelegating.
