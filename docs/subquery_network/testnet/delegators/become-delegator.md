# How to Become a Delegator

## Introduction 

Welcome to the **step-by-step guide to becoming a Delegator.** This guide explains what is a delegator and what you can contribute as a delegator. 

It also gives you an insight into what benefits you can avail as a delegator. 

Before you begin exploring further, visit [Frontier](https://frontier.subquery.network/explorer) - SubQueryâ€™s Testnet. This guide takes this testnet into account.  
 

## Why to Become a Delegator?

As a delegator, you not only delegate SQT to inexers, but you also validate and support indexers to provide their service with better rewards. If needed, you can also undelegate from an indexer. And thus, you help the network to become more transparent and secure. 

In return, you get your share of rewards(in SQT) from the reward pool.

As a delegator, you can perform the following tasks: 

1. Delegation and Undelegation of your SQT
2. Claim and Withdraw Rewards


Now, let's have a look at the process of delegation and undelegation.
