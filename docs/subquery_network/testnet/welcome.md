### Explorer

- This area displays a list of all the projects that are being indexed. It’s also the place where consumers can search and purchase plans. 
- If no plans are listed, it indicated that the Indexer has not yet created a plan. Note that the Indexers can also purchase their own plans.

- Allows Indexers and Delegators to manage their [stake](../terminology.md#staking), [delegation](../terminology.md#delegating), rewards, and view tokens that are [locked](../terminology.md#lock-period).
