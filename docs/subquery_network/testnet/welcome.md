# Welcome

Welcome to [Kepler](https://kepler.thechaindata.com), SubQuery's canary network. The Kepler network is the final stage before mainnet where network participants can be part of the SubQuery network and be rewarded with kSQT tokens which have real-world value.

Learn how to participate as an [Indexer](../introduction.md), a [Delegator](../introduction.md), or a [Consumer](../introduction.md), and become familiar with all the features of the network.

The Kepler dashboard is divided into several sections as can be seen below.

### Explorer

The explorer displays a list of all the projects that are being indexed. It’s also the place where consumers can select a particular project and purchase the associated plans. If no plans are listed, this indicates that an Indexer has not yet created a plan.

- Allows Delegators to select Indexers and delegate their [SQT](../token.md).
